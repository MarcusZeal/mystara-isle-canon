Eboncrest stands as the central hub of Mystara Isle, a bustling city where all major roads converge, avoiding the treacherous Dragonspire Mountains. The city is strategically situated, making it a vital link between the eastern and western regions of the isle. The Wyrmstail River flows through the heart of Eboncrest, dividing the city into two vibrant halves before emptying into the expansive Deep Blue.

#### Key Features

1. **Redrise**: Located on the western side of the Wyrmstail River, Redrise is the economic heart of Eboncrest. Here, merchants from across Mystara gather to trade goods, from exotic spices to magical artifacts. The district is always buzzing with activity, filled with colorful stalls and the sounds of haggling.
2. **Old Town**: The eastern half of Eboncrest, known as Old Town, is the historical and cultural center of the city. It features ancient architecture, grand libraries, and the city's oldest temple dedicated to the gods of Mystara. The narrow, winding streets of Old Town are rich with stories and secrets waiting to be uncovered. This area also hosts the old docks, now a shadow of their former glory but still bustling with local fishermen and traders.
3. **The Grand Bridge**: Spanning the Wyrmstail River, the Grand Bridge connects Redrise and Old Town. This majestic structure is not only a feat of engineering but also a symbol of unity for the city. Lined with statues and lanterns, it is a popular spot for festivals and public gatherings.
4. **Pearl Docks**: Adjacent to the Citadel on the west side of the river, Pearl Docks is a gated dock area reserved for the wealthiest merchants and dignitaries. This secure area ensures that high-value goods and important visitors are protected at all times.
5. **South Docks**: Situated on the west side of the river within the main city walls, South Docks is a smaller district that handles most of the city's day-to-day maritime activities. It's a lively area with numerous taverns and inns catering to sailors and traders.
6. **New Hearth**: On the outskirts of the eastern side of the city lies New Hearth, a sprawling shantytown. This area is home to the city's poorest residents, many of whom live in makeshift homes and struggle to make ends meet. Despite its challenges, New Hearth is a community bound by resilience and hope.
7. **The Citadel**: Overlooking the city from a hilltop on the western bank, the Citadel is the seat of Eboncrest's government and the residence of its ruling council. This imposing fortress is a symbol of strength and stability, offering protection to the city's inhabitants and serving as a center for political affairs.
