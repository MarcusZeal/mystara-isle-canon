title: A Letter from Thomas Thorne
---
> To whomever may find this,
> 
> I have returned to Castle Thorne, our family's ancestral seat, only to find it crumbling under the weight of years and sorrow. The proud towers that once touched the heavens are now broken, and the gardens—once a testament to our deep connection with the natural world—are overrun with twisted vines and thorns. The great halls where laughter once echoed are now filled with silence and shadows.
> 
> It is in this desolation that I find myself, the last of the Thornes. Or so I believe. There was one, my brother, who was always more attuned to the wilds than to the trappings of our lineage. He left the house years ago, drawn by the call of the forest, and we lost contact. The land itself has not yielded any sign of his return. I fear the worst—that he, too, has been claimed by the same catastrophe that has taken everything else. Yet, some part of me wonders if he is still out there, hidden among the trees he loved so dearly, perhaps even unaware of the darkness that has befallen us all.
> 
> As I walked through the ruins of our home, my feet led me to the docks, where our family’s last great creation—the *Elderbranch*—still rests upon the water, untouched by the decay that has claimed the rest of our legacy. This ship, built from Lunashard-infused oak, remains as strong and timeless as the day it was launched. The very essence of the moon, they said, was woven into its timbers, granting it a resilience against the ravages of time.
> 
> The *Elderbranch* was meant to carry us to safety, to new lands untouched by the shadow that now looms over everything. But the world changed too quickly, and now this ship lies here, without a captain, without a crew. The preservation runes in the pantry may still hold food, though I dare not hope too much. What use is sustenance when the soul hungers for something more?
> 
> The flowery carvings on the beams are as beautiful as ever, yet they seem a cruel reminder of the world we’ve lost. They were meant to honor the spirits of the forest, to bind our fate to the land. Now, that connection feels like a chain, pulling us back into the darkness we sought to escape.
>   
> I am Thomas Thorne, the last of my line, and I know that I must try to cleanse this castle, to rid it of the curse that now festers within its walls. The darkness here is strong, and I fear what may happen if I fall in my attempt. If I fail, this curse may twist even my body, turning me into something unrecognizable,  my love for nature and vines twisted by the very nature I once cherished. The thought chills me, but I cannot let it stop me. This is my duty, and I must try.
> 
> Should I not return, the *Elderbranch* will be without a master. It is a ship waiting for a captain, a relic of a past that will not die until it is given new purpose. I leave this vessel to you, the one who finds it. Perhaps you can rename it, as it no longer bears the weight of the Thorne name. Perhaps it will sail under a new banner, find new horizons that I will never see.
> 
> My brother may be gone, and the house of Thorne may soon be nothing more than a memory, but this ship remains. It was built to endure, and so it has. May it carry you safely through the storms that lie ahead, and may you find the hope that I have lost.
> 
> If you are reading this, know that the *Elderbranch* is more than just a ship—it is a lifeline. Take it, name it as you will, and may the winds carry you to safety. I leave this ship in your hands, with what little hope I have left—that it will serve you well, as it once served my family.
> 
> Should I fall, I fear what may become of me, and what curse may yet claim my body. But I must try. I cannot let this darkness consume all that is left.
> 
> May the wind be at your back, and may the *Elderbranch*—or whatever name you choose—bring you to safe harbors. My time may be ending, but yours has only just begun.
> 
> With a heavy heart,
> **Thomas Thorne**  
> **The Last of the Thornes**
