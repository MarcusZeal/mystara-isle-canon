#### Setting the Scene

> As you step into The Arcane Repository, you are immediately enveloped in an atmosphere of mystique and wonder. Shelves line the walls from floor to ceiling, filled with ancient tomes, scrolls, and a myriad of magical artifacts. The air is filled with a faint, otherworldly glow emanating from various enchanted items. The soft rustle of pages and the occasional spark of arcane energy create an ambiance of deep, scholarly knowledge.
> 
> Before you stands Zala Gritfang, a formidable Gnoll woman with a keen mind for magic and business. She is well-respected in the magical community of Dawnham for her expertise and fair dealings. Despite her gnollish heritage, which often invokes fear or mistrust, Zala has built a reputation for being knowledgeable, reliable, and surprisingly charming. She is known for her quick wit and no-nonsense attitude, but also for her willingness to help those in genuine need.
