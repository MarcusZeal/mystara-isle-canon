### Narrative Recap 

> During your celebrating in North Lodge, you were each gifted an item of extreme power from the villagers of North Lodge. These were your reward and you got the impression that they weren't all that impressive to the townspeople themselves. Curious since each weapon or item  is stronger than anything any of you could have imagined from your life on earth.
> 
> Once well rested and attuned to your new items, you set out towards Eboncrest. 
> 
> On the road you interacted with [[Aelorian's Essence]], the sentient necklace. The necklace told you of the [[01. The Golden Age of the Eldorans]] as well as a little bit about these Lunashards. 
> 
> Later, you met a shifty traveler. He started asking about Lunashards and if you've seen any. You thought Ren might have eaten one. You guys got a bit murderhobo-y on him and sent him away terrified of the other travelers on this road.
> 
> When entering Eboncrest, you met a little girl who had lost her mom. Without any coaxing whatsoever you helped her find her way back to her mom at the Minotaur's Milk, the only Inn in the city. 
> 
> At the Inn, you met up with [[Elara Willowhart]], where Sylvain told her about all that had transpired. Elara didn't seem to be particularly worried about the situation, but did ask them to come over to her shop to discuss it further. 
> 
> At her shop, [[The Whispering Willow]], you met her little brother and learned a bit more about how Vyrra was just a ghost story the elves used to tell their children. She seemed concerned and relieved about the events that transpired at North Lodge and asked you to investigate the Curse of Castle Thorn shortly. 
> 
> She also mentioned you should stop by the Adventurers Guild to register as adventurers on your way out of town. Sylvain was not interested at all. The party begrudgingly registered at the interest of Garos. You didn't all use your real names here... And now those fake names, if you used them, are magically inscribed onto these adventurer badges. 
> 
> You rested for the night and headed out to Castle Thorn early the next morning. You left at roughly 6am. It's just about noon now. What do you do?



### Quest Hook: The Curse of Castle Thorne

**Introduction at The Whispering Willow:**

As the adventurers converse with Elara Willowhart at The Whispering Willow, she leans in, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper.

**Elara Willowhart:**

> _“There is a place not far from Eboncrest, along the coast, that has fallen into shadow and danger—**Castle Thorne**. Once a proud symbol of nobility, the castle has been overtaken by a terrible curse. Dark roses now engulf its walls, and its former guardians have turned into monstrous versions of themselves: Rose Guard, Knights of the Flowers, and Hedge Mages.”_

She pauses, her eyes filled with concern.

> _“The curse has begun to spread outward like weeds, overtaking the small village outside the castle. I don’t know why this has happened, but the curse now threatens to engulf the surrounding lands. Will you investigate and destroy the cause of this curse?”_

**Objective:**

Investigate Castle Thorne, uncover the source of the curse, and cleanse the castle and surrounding village of its dark influence.

**Key Challenges:**

- **Rose Guard**: Former noble protectors, now cursed warriors.
- **Knights of the Flowers**: Elite knights transformed into formidable enemies.
- **Hedge Mages**: Cursed spellcasters wielding twisted nature magic.
- **Awdreetoo**: Malevolent tree-like creatures spreading the curse.

**Rewards:**

- Gratitude from the people of Eboncrest and Eldertree Grove.
- Access to hidden treasures and ancient artifacts within Castle Thorne.
- Potential alliances with those freed from the curse.
- **A scale-bound tomb** - a hook to Mazerisha.
- **A map of the world** - a hook off Mystara.

**Notes:**

- The curse is tied to an ancient artifact hidden deep within the castle.
- Lifting the curse may require destroying the artifact or performing a specific ritual.
- The heroes will discover through old books or Aelorian’s memories that the Thorne family were not the kindest rulers in the past, leading to their downfall and the curse placed by the Mistress of Shadows.

---

**Follow-up:**

After agreeing to take on the quest, the adventurers receive a map from Elara detailing the location of Castle Thorne and known dangers within. As they make their preparations, they are filled with a sense of foreboding and excitement for the challenges that lie ahead.

### Major Locations

#### 1. Ville De Fleurian

- **Introduction to the Village:**

  > "You step into Ville De Fleurian, a once thriving village now overgrown with thick vines and dense foliage. The air is filled with the sweet, intoxicating scent of blooming flowers. Despite the beauty, there's an eerie sense of abandonment, as if the village itself is holding its breath."

- **General Description:**

  > "You know this place is cursed, the creeping vines and invasive plant life are clear evidence of that. The village is eerily silent, with no sign of the former villagers who once called this place home."

- **Passive Perception Check (DC 15) (within 30 feet of Awdreetoo):**
  - **If they fail:** "As you walk through the deserted streets of the village, you detect a pleasing smell flowing through the air. A moment ago, you could swear that the houses here were overgrown by creeping vines, but now all you can see are beautiful flowers. They beckon you with their sweet scent, demanding to be smelled."
  - **If they succeed:** "As you move closer, you notice something off about the flowers. Their placement seems too deliberate, almost as if they are hiding something beneath."
- **Nature Check (DC 12):**
  - **Success:** "You recognize the flowers as part of an Awdreetoo, a dangerous plant creature known for luring its prey with sweet scents and trapping them with its vines."
  - **Failure:** "The flowers seem innocent enough, but there's an unsettling feeling in your gut that something isn’t right."
- **Investigation Check (DC 12):**
  - **Success:** "Upon closer inspection, you spot thick, creeping vines camouflaged among the flowers, leading back to a central mass hidden just out of sight. It's a trap!"
  - **Failure:** "You find nothing unusual about the flowers, but the feeling of unease grows stronger."

**Monsters:**

- **1x [[Awdreetoo]]:** Positioned near the center of the village, using Creeping Vines to lure and trap intruders.
- **2x [[Rose Guard]]:** Patrolling the streets, using Barbed Spear and Barb Blast to harass adventurers from a distance.
- **3x [[Plant Zombie]] (Homebrew):** Former villagers turned into plant zombies, serving as basic melee combatants.

#### 2. Gatehouse

- "You approach the castle and see the imposing gatehouse. Some of the structure has crumbled, but two stories of solid stone still overlook the drawbridge."
- "You think you spot movement through the arrow slits on the second story, but you can’t be certain."

- The left side of the castle (from your perspective) is collapsed, allowing you access to the castle... if you can get past the guards.

**Monsters:**

- **2x [[Hedge Mage]]:** Positioned on the second floor, using Crown of Roses and Floral Staff to control and damage intruders.
- **3x [[Rose Guard]]:** Two on the second floor and one at the entrance, using ranged attacks to pick off adventurers.

#### 3. Castle grounds

The grounds can be accessed by breaking down the barricaded door or by finding a way through the towers and over the parapet that runs all along the castle walls. Placed along both the parapet and in the castle grounds are braziers still filled with dried wood. When ignited these will provide both a longlasting light source and access to fire that might come in handy later. The large double doors just beyond the gatehouse grant access to the castle interior.

**Monsters:**

- **1x [[Knight of Flowers]]:** Patrolling the grounds, ready to use Pollen Pound and Vineblade on any intruders.
- **2x [[Rose Guard]]:** Positioned along the parapet, using ranged attacks from above.

#### 4. Throne Room (Boss Battle)

- The hall's entrance from the south is blocked by two Awdretoo, huge plant monsters - the same as what the heroes saw in town.

> _“When entering this large chamber you can clearly see that once this was a place of grandeur and opulence. The beautifully carved throne in the back of the room has intricate designs of roses and dancing children.”_

- There are many vines in this room that try to draw in and drain anyone foolish enough to come close. They are connected to the flesh eating plants deeper in the castle and can let them know that fresh meat has arrived.
- The throne has remained untouched by the vines and doesn’t show any signs of decay, remaining just as pristine as the day it was made. However, sitting upon her throne is the Thorned Empress - a **huge** monstrosity of plant and flesh.
- A stone dragon head overlooks the room with crystal eyes that seem to glow in the diffused light coming through the windows.

**Monsters:**

- **1x [[Thorned Empress]]:** The boss of the castle, using all her abilities to protect the throne room.
- **2x [[Awdreetoo]]:** Positioned near the entrance, using Creeping Vines and Vine Whip to restrain and damage intruders.

After killing the Thorned Empress, the players can pick up [[Thornalin]]

![[Thornalin]]

#### 5. Dining Hall

- The wreckage in the dining hall seems to indicate that there was a violent struggle here not too long ago.
- Sturdy furniture was thrown around and broken with considerable force.

#### 6. Kitchen

The kitchen has remained mostly untouched, seeming to indicate that the plant creatures don’t have an appetite for bread or cheeses. Quite a lot of edible food is still here, safely stored in sealed barrels. Strangely, there is a fire blazing under a pot with an unknown liquid bubbling in it.

**Monsters:**

- **1x [[Hedge Mage]]:** Hidden, using illusion spells to trick and control the adventurers.
- **1x [[Plant Mimic]] :** A mimic disguised as a barrel, attacking when adventurers get close.

#### 7. The Flowery

- In the back of the castle grounds is a sitting area with bushes filled with large blooming roses all around it.
- Once this must have been a well kept place for quiet contemplation but now the bushes are unkempt and growing wildly.
- Some of the roses here are still blue, but with a red hue overtaking them.

**Monsters:**

- **2x [[Rose Guard]]:** Using the dense foliage for cover, ambushing adventurers.
- **1x [[Hedge Mage]]:** Using Faerie Fire and Entangle to control the battlefield.

#### 8. Stairwells

These stairs connect to the different floors of the castle. The way down leads to the underground caves and the cellar that functions as the botanical study. Taking the stairs up leads to the second floor of the castle interior and the gallery of stone.

**Monsters:**

- **2x [[Rose Guard]]:** Positioned at the top and bottom of the stairs, using Barbed Spear to attack from above and below.

#### 9. Gallery of Stone

> _“Rounding the corner, you come upon a display of stone statues overlooking the throne room below. The statues are very well made and almost lifelike in appearance. They must depict ancient heroes, great warriors who had their images captured in stone as a commemoration of some great deed.”_

**History Check (DC 12)**

- These statues were commissioned in honor of five heroes that saved Ville De Fleurian from a terrible monster attack.
- Sadly, it wasn’t even a year later that the experiments with the magical elixir would go devastatingly wrong, creating the many plant monsters that have now overtaken the village and castle.

**Investigation Check (DC 12)**

- The stone sword that one of the statues is holding is slightly cracked, revealing something gleaming inside it.

**Arcana Check (DC 12)** : The sword is giving off magical energy.

**Strength Check (DC 20)** : You smash the statue, revealing [[The Grey]] inside.

![[The Grey]]

**Monsters:**

- **1x [[Knight of Flowers]]:** Guarding the gallery, using Multiattack and Crimson Bloom.
- **2x [[Plant Zombie]] :** Hidden among the statues, attacking when adventurers approach.

#### 10. Holding Cells

- Whenever the plants lure in more victims than they can eat at the time, the remainder is taken to this room and placed in cells made from wooden bars.
- It is unclear if these cells were here before the plant creatures took over or if they created them.
- There are still some remains in the cells of the unfortunate souls that were brought here.

**Monsters:**

- **1x [[Awdreetoo]]:** Guarding the cells, using Creeping Vines to restrain intruders.
- **2x [[Plant Zombie]] (Homebrew):** Former prisoners turned into plant zombies.

#### 11. Royal Bedroom

- This small room has 3 Flesh Eating Plants.

**Reward**: Upon clearing this room, the PCs can find a Snake-Scaled Tomb on the bedroom end-table.

**Monsters:**

- **3x [[Flesh-Eating Plant]]:** Powerful plants using oversized mouths and vines to attack and grab adventurers.

#### 12. Botanical Study

> _“Descending the stairs brings you to a chamber filled with books, vials and strange instruments. The sweet scent of the flowers further in the chamber mixes with a biting scent that clings to the back of your throat. Clearly many alchemical components are present here, presenting a danger to careless hands.”_

- Samples of the various experiments that were conducted here are still present, as well as many alchemical components, books on both botany and alchemy, instruments of all sorts and scrolls filled with strange arcane symbols.
- One versed in both matters of the arcane and the study of nature could work many wonders here or create more terrible magical concoctions.

**If the players search the bookshelves, they can find:**

- The Rise and Fall of the Vrael
  - ![[The Rise and Fall of the Vrael]]
- A Partially Torn World Map (Hook to WC and the open world)
  ![[Bottom-Left.jpg]]
- You find a crumpled piece of parchment among the old books and alchemical equipment in the basement. The handwriting is hurried but legible:
    >     
    >     To whomever finds this, 
    >     
    >     I must confess that I feel a deep shame for what we have done. The statue upstairs, the one molded after the great hero who once saved our village, hides more than just his likeness. Bound within the statue itself is his powerful weapon, a tool for good that could turn the tide against the darkness that has fallen upon us.    
    >     
    >     It is tragic that such a powerful artifact is locked away, hidden in plain sight, when it could be used to protect and save our people. The hero it was modeled after would never have wanted it to be kept like this. He believed in action, in fighting for what is right, and in using his gifts to make the world a better place.    
    >     
    >     If you have found this note, I implore you to go upstairs and investigate the statue. The weapon bound within it could be the key to restoring hope to this cursed place.
    >     
    >     May you succeed where we have failed.
    >     
- Notes mentioning about Lunashards
> To those who may come after,
> 
> I write this with a heavy heart and a mind burdened by concern. I fear the Lunashards are becoming scarce. And, with Vyra's rise to power, I fear for the future. She has shown a dangerous ambition, one that could lead to disastrous consequences. There are whispers that she might do something rash, something that could involve the royals. I hope with all my being that she refrains from any such actions.
> 
> The Lunashards are already rare, and if Vyra's plans lead to further conflict, we could face a dire shortage. This would not only cripple our constructs but also weaken our defenses against the looming threats. The balance we have maintained for so long is fragile, and any disruption could spell catastrophe.
> 
> If you find this note, please understand the gravity of the situation. The power of the Lunashards must be preserved, and our actions must be measured and wise. 
> 
> May wisdom guide us through these dark times.


If the players attempt to do some alchemy here send them through a skill check guantlet. If they succeed, they'll create the [[Piranha Potion]].

##### Craft That Potion

Creating a super powerful potion should be a challenging and rewarding process. Here is a detailed progression with three very difficult skill checks:

###### Stage 1: Gathering Rare Ingredients

- **Skill Check:** Nature (or Survival)
- **DC:** 18
- **Description:** "You need to locate and gather rare ingredients from the dangerous and magical areas surrounding the castle. This requires an in-depth knowledge of the local flora and a keen eye for detail."
- **Success:** "You successfully identify and gather the rare ingredients needed for the potion. These ingredients are crucial for the potion's potency."
- **Failure:** "You struggle to find the right ingredients and end up with a mixture of common plants. You can try again after spending more time searching, but it will delay the process."

###### Stage 2: Brewing the Base Potion

- **Skill Check:** Arcana (or Alchemist's Supplies proficiency)
- **DC:** 20
- **Description:** "You must carefully brew the base potion, ensuring that the magical properties of the ingredients are correctly extracted and combined. This requires precise control over the brewing process and a deep understanding of magical alchemy."
- **Success:** "You manage to brew the base potion perfectly, creating a strong foundation for the super powerful potion."
- **Failure:** "The potion mixture starts bubbling uncontrollably, and you have to quickly dispose of it to prevent an explosion. You will need to gather the ingredients again and start over."

###### Stage 3: Infusing with Magical Energy

- **Skill Check:** Arcana (or Spellcasting Ability)
- **DC:** 22
- **Description:** "The final step involves infusing the potion with a concentrated burst of magical energy. This requires channeling your magical power directly into the potion without destabilizing it."
- **Success:** "You successfully infuse the potion with magical energy, resulting in a super powerful potion that glows with an intense, magical light."
- **Failure:** "The infusion process goes awry, causing the potion to become volatile and lose its potency. You will need to brew a new base potion and try the infusion again. **One Awdreetoo spawns with half HP.** "
