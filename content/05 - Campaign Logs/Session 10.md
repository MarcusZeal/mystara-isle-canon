### Recap

... A few hours ago you entered into this Tomb of Mother Medusa. 

... You just finished combat with Mazerisha. ... 





### **1. Convo with Mazerisha**

You learned that this was an old tomb created by some ancient dwarvan paladins who sought to help Mazerisha and harbor her from her tormentors and siblings. These paladins are said to have worshiped Mazerisha as a goddess. Unable to remove her curse, they locked her away in a deep sleep. 

This sleep was disturbed by the archeologists. 

Recently awoken, her bracers continued to curse all creatures to whisper lies to her. Since her hair are snakes, they were constantly speaking lies and tormenting her - driving her insecure, delusional .. crazy. 

Now that the curse has been lifted you can tell that she is a kind-hearted respectable woman. 

Free from her familial bonds and responsibilities, she would like to set out to explore the world. Vodari is vast. She thinks that she'll set sail to explore it herself. 

Mazerisha is a non-combat NPC. She's a skilled chef. 

She is willing to join the party.

### **2. Leaving the Dungeon**

> As your group steps out of the dwarven dungeon—once a temple dedicated to Mazerisha—the weight of the ancient halls lingers. The sunlight is a stark contrast to the dim, mechanical depths you’ve just escaped, and the air feels fresh against your skin. Mazerisha walks beside you, free from the curse that held her for so long, though still shaken by the ordeal.
> 
> Posidonius, you can’t stop thinking about the intricate machines and ancient devices the dwarves once used to honor Mazerisha. There’s something about the way those contraptions seamlessly blended magic and technology that has sparked your curiosity. The journey back to the village is quiet, but in your mind, the gears of possibility are already turning.

### **3. The Prelude - A Sense of Restlessness**

Sylvain says some racist things to Mazerisha. 


> As your group walks the path, there’s a strange sense of finality in the air. Snappy, you’ve always been attuned to the wild magic coursing through you, but now there’s an unfamiliar feeling—a quiet restlessness that has been growing stronger with each passing day. The dungeon’s mechanical wonders, the precision of the dwarven craftsmanship, and the latent magic within those ancient creations have awakened something deep within you.


Posidinous and Sylvain talk for a bit about magic. 



> Snappy, that night, as the group makes camp, you find yourself unable to rest. The stars above seem to shimmer more brightly, and the air hums with a faint energy, as if the world itself is alive with possibilities. The dreams that come to you are vivid—visions of towering mountains, of mighty hammers striking anvils, and of powerful forces shaping raw materials into something more. 


> In the heart of these visions stands a figure, a gnome-like woman with a radiant presence, her hands crafting wonders from metal and magic alike. She is Sindri, and her eyes seem to peer directly into your soul, as if recognizing something within you.


> Snappy, you feel a growing urge to separate from the others, to find a place where you can be alone with these strange new feelings. Drawn by an inexplicable force, you wander off into the nearby mountains, following an ancient path that seems to call to you.




### **4. The Transformation - Sindri’s Forge**


> Deep within the mountains, you stumble upon a hidden forge, long abandoned by mortals but still pulsing with magical energy. The forge is unlike anything you have ever seen—massive, intricately designed, and clearly of dwarven make. The air is thick with the smell of metal and magic, and the walls are adorned with the symbols of Sindri.
> 
> As you step closer to the forge, the visions return, more intense than before. The wild magic within you stirs, but it is no longer chaotic and untamed; it feels focused, directed by an unseen hand. Your body begins to glow, your form shifting and changing as the power of the forge flows through you.
> 
   Your shell cracks and falls away, revealing a new form beneath—a towering Goliath, your skin marked with intricate tattoos of dwarven design, symbols of Sindri’s forge.



> Sindri herself appears before you in the vision, her voice like the ringing of a hammer on anvil. “You have been chosen,” she says, “to be my instrument, my zealot, to carry my will into the world. The raw power within you has been forged into something greater—use it to create, to protect, and to destroy only when necessary. You are my champion now, and through you, my work will continue.”


---



### **5. The Awakening - A New Purpose**

> When the transformation is complete, Snappy—now a Goliath—awakens in the forge, your mind clear and your purpose renewed. The chaotic wild magic that once defined you is now a focused force, tempered by Sindri’s guidance. You feel stronger, more resilient, and filled with a new sense of purpose. The tools of the forge call to you, and you instinctively understand their use, as if you have always known.
> 
> As you leave the forge, the symbols of Sindri glowing softly on your skin, you know that you have been reborn. No longer just a warrior, you are now a Zealot of Sindri, driven by a divine purpose to forge your path in the world, to create and to protect, to bring the power of the forge to bear against your enemies. The mountains around you seem smaller, the world more vibrant, filled with the potential for creation and change.




---



### **6. The Return - Rejoining the Group**

> When Snappy—now a Goliath—returns to the group, they notice the change immediately. Your once bulky shell is gone, replaced by the muscular form of a Goliath, your eyes burning with a newfound intensity. The tattoos on your skin seem to pulse with energy, and there is a quiet confidence in your movements that was not there before.
> 
> You tell them of your encounter with Sindri, of the hidden forge and your transformation. You speak with a clarity and purpose that is new, your words filled with the power of your divine patron. Sindri has given you a mission, and you intend to fulfill it, using your newfound strength and the divine power of the forge to protect your friends and forge a new path for yourself in this world.

### **7. At the Inn inside of Glenthorp**

> The inn is a haven after your long trek. The fire crackles in the hearth, casting a warm glow that contrasts with the cold, metallic chambers of the dungeon. While the others relax, Posidonius, you find yourself drawn to the cast of ale you found. As you're thoroughly looking over this cast, you notice a small, peculiar trinket — a dwarven-made object with faint engravings that pulse with latent magic. It seems simple at first, but something about it feels incomplete, as though it’s waiting for a final touch....
> 
> Mazerisha, who is still piecing together her memories of the dwarves and their creations, notices your fascination. "They were always making things," she says softly, more to herself than to you. "The dwarves… they would spend days, weeks, on a single item, pouring their magic into it. They said it was like... unlocking the secrets of the world."
> 
> Her words are vague, born more of observation than understanding, but they resonate with you. That night, while the others sleep, you find yourself unable to rest. You take out your tools, and with a strange sense of purpose, begin to work on the trinket, your hands moving almost of their own accord, guided by a newfound instinct.
> 
> As you work, the trinket begins to respond, the engravings glowing brighter, gears clicking into place. It hums with energy, transformed by your touch. You feel a spark of excitement—this is more than just an artifact; it’s something you’ve created. A new understanding dawns on you: you’re not just seeing the future; you’re beginning to shape it.

### **8. Still In Glenthorp**

~~As the days pass in Glenthorp, the town is willing to put you up for three nights... but it’s clear they are wary of Mazerisha and uneasy about the deaths of so many of their townspeople, even though they were zealots. The villagers are grateful for your help, but there’s an underlying tension in their hospitality.~~

- ~~You find buyers for the weapons and gems you discovered.~~ 
- ~~The archaeologist, still tied up, expresses great interest in purchasing the items and offers a fair price, hinting at a better deal if you can "get her out of this mess."~~
- ~~You can choose to sell to her or wait for other vendors as you continue your journey. The decision is yours, but remember—this village is ready for you to move on.~~



**Upon entering the village, the party stopped Theadora from being hung. Threatened to kill the entire village.** 

**The team literally starts the entire village on fire, all their boats, and murders everyone....**

### **9. Back On The Boatussy Prime**

- **Mazerisha** is excited to be on the ship. Bright eyed and beyond happy to be free and seeing the world. 
- **Aelorian** gives some vague clues about what Lunashards are. He mentions the god Lupara and explain how he remembers stories of how benevolant she once was. 
	- They worshipped **Lupara, the Moon Huntress**, a powerful deity representing the moon and the hunt.
	- It's a shame that she's gone silent all these years... almost like she's not even around anymore... don't you think that's odd? Well anyway... **I'm done talking for today.**  


- Sylvain is depressed. The team has a little moment. 
	- "Its okay man. I dont think any of us are real" ~ Garos
	- "I say thank you here... I think you non-elves say to each other when you want them to stop talking...." ~ Sylvain

### **11. Garos’ Vision After a Long Rest**

> **Garos,** as you drift into sleep, the world around you fades to black. At first, there's nothing but darkness and silence, but slowly, the familiar warmth of your Matchstick Maul begins to seep into the void. You reach for it instinctively, but your fingers grasp only air. The warmth intensifies, turning into a searing heat that spreads across your body, igniting your senses.
> 
> Suddenly, the darkness shatters, and you find yourself standing in a vast, fiery wasteland. The ground beneath your feet is cracked and molten, and the air is thick with the stench of brimstone. In the distance, you see a towering figure, a monstrous silhouette wreathed in flames. As it approaches, you recognize the shape of the skeletal finger from your maul, now grown to immense proportions, pointing directly at you.
> 
> The finger beckons, and the earth trembles with each of its movements. The flames that once merely flickered along the maul's surface now roar to life, spiraling around you in a fiery vortex. The heat is unbearable, and you feel your scales beginning to blister and crack under the pressure. You try to move, to fight, but your body is paralyzed, rooted to the spot by some unseen force.
> 
> The finger extends closer, its burning tip inches from your chest, and you feel a pull, deep within your core. The flames surge, enveloping you completely. Pain explodes through every fiber of your being, a burning so intense it feels like your very soul is being incinerated. You let out a roar, but it is swallowed by the inferno surrounding you.
> 
> Just when you think you can bear no more, the flames begin to recede, leaving behind a dull, throbbing ache. As the fire pulls away, you notice something strange—your scales are peeling away, crumbling into ash and revealing a layer of fresh, raw skin beneath. The sight is horrifying, yet you cannot look away as your body is laid bare, piece by piece.
> 
> Then, from beneath your charred scales, something new emerges. Dark, inky lines etch themselves into your exposed flesh, forming jagged, claw-like shapes that pulse with a faint, eerie light. These marks twist and wind around your limbs, their presence both alien and powerful. The pain subsides, replaced by a strange, calm energy that spreads through your veins.
> 
> You blink, and the wasteland begins to fade, the flames and the skeletal finger dissolving into nothingness. But the tattoos remain, their eldritch patterns now fully formed and glowing softly in the darkness.
> 
> As you awaken with a start, drenched in sweat, you realize that the transformation was no mere dream. Your body feels different, lighter, more agile. You glance down and see the tattoo, its inky tendrils marking your skin where the maul once did. The warrior you were is gone, replaced by something new—something more.
> 
> You are no longer bound by the weight of the maul, but instead, you feel a connection to something deeper, something primal. The essence of the Matchstick Maul now flows through you, not as a weapon in your hand, but as a force within your very being. You have shed your old self, quite literally, and emerged as a monk, a master of your own inner fire.
> 
> As you rise to your feet, you feel the power of the Eldritch Claw Tattoo coursing through you. Your fists clench, and you sense that your strikes are now infused with the same eldritch energy that once powered your maul. You are reborn, not just in form, but in purpose. The nightmare has passed, but the transformation is real.
> 
> You are the flame.

### **11. The Next Morning**

> The next morning, **Posidonius,** you feel different. The act of working on the trinket has unlocked something inside you. You join the group for breakfast, the weight of the previous day's events still fresh, but there’s a new energy in you. Mazerisha, still recovering but observant, gives you a curious glance, sensing a change she can’t quite explain.
> 
> “The dwarves…” she starts, hesitant, “they were always talking about how the world could be… shaped. They never said how, but they believed it.” Her words are halting, unsure, but they stir something in you. The group prepares to leave the inn, but you know your path has shifted. The relics and machines of the dungeon were not just remnants of the past—they were a glimpse of your future.

### **The Letter**


> **"Garos,**
> 
> I hope this letter finds you well, old friend. It's been too long since we last spoke, and I’ve had plenty of time to reflect on our days in the military. We went through a lot together, and there’s something I’ve been meaning to say. I’m sorry for the way things ended between us. I know you had your reasons for leaving, and I should have understood that better at the time.
> 
> Since then, I’ve left the army myself, though I’ll admit, the higher-ups aren’t too pleased about it. I’ve heard they might be holding a grudge, so you might want to keep your head low for a while. But enough about that—I didn’t write just to dredge up the past.
> 
> I’ve come across something that made me think of you right away. There’s a treasure hunt happening in a seaside village called **Undertow** on an island called  **Saru** to the south east.
> 
> It’s supposed to be quite the event—lots of excitement and, if the rumors are true, riches beyond our wildest dreams. With your skill and experience, I know you’d be invaluable on this kind of adventure.
> 
> I’ve included a discount coupon with this letter. It’s good for up to eight people, so bring along any new friends you’ve made on your travels. I’m already here in Undertow, and the village is everything you’d want—peaceful, friendly, and the perfect place to relax and catch up.
> 
> But more than that, this treasure hunt could be exactly what we need to relive some of those old glories and maybe even discover something truly remarkable. I can’t wait to see you again, Garos. Let’s make some new memories, for old times’ sake.
> 
> Your comrade,  
> Erisol Shyx

 
- They can sale to **Saru** in 3 days. From there, **Undertow** is a harbor village on the coast.

### Undertow
- The people here are friendly, but cautious. 
- You notice there are very few races here *other* than elves. You all stand out as travelers. **But** there are many travelers here for the same event you are. 
- You're able to walk freely in the small harbor town. There are all the vendors you would expect there to be. 
  
  
### Teppa Tapp. 
  
>  The sun is setting as you traverse the long boardwalk on the seafront of Undertow. The smell of the sea air hits your face as you see several fishing boats starting to bring in their hauls As you walk along, you can hear the calls of several market stalls as they hawk fresh scallops, smoked haddock, and other local delicacies.
> 
>  As you pass by a tavern, you see a pair of young, smiling half-orcs walk away from a tiefling woman. As you look over, she turns to match your gaze, then grasps her satchel and begins to approach. She bows slightly with one hand on her top hat fascinator perched between her swept-back horns and introduces herself.
> 
> **“Teppa Tapp at your service! You seem like the kind of people who are looking for an adventure!”**
