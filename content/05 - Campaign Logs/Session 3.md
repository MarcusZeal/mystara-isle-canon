### Narrative Recap
> 
> The adventure together started in [[North Lodge]], where strange goblin attacks had disrupted the peace. At Lila the Herbalist’s suggestion, the party investigated rather than attacked the goblins. Their journey led them to the Enchanted Glade, where they encountered wildlife and goblin scouts. Using a clever spell and displaying the symbol of Grumshar, the party convinced the goblins they were allies and were welcomed into the Hidden Cave.
> 
> Inside the cave, they found a bustling goblin society, illuminated by luminescent fungi and campfires. They observed goblins working, socializing, and training. Some goblins seemed different, but you couldn’t pinpoint why. 
> 
> The party was escorted to Krag Rock-Biter, a respected goblin, who welcomed them cautiously. Krag explained that some goblins had been acting strangely and implied a hidden threat among them.
> 
> The party explored further, learning more about the goblin society and their worship of **Grumshar**. They found torn note fragments hinting at a plot involving shapeshifters and a **Mistress**. As their illusion spell wore off, Krag revealed that they accepted the party for their cunning and ambition, traits valued by goblins, and that they never truly believed they were physically goblins. 
> 
> The party then descended to Grukthar Hollow, a more strategic part of the cave. Here, they met Grubnar, the Warchief, who confirmed their suspicions of shapeshifters. He tasked them with investigating old ruins in Bear Wood, providing them with supplies and a map.(The map is on the wiki).
> 
> On their way to the ruins, the party was ambushed by Barghests, shapeshifting creatures sent by the Mistress. After a tough battle, the party realized that they all come from Earth, a revelation spurred by the Barghests’ comments. 
>  
   However, instead of focusing on that monumental plot point, they focused on Thistle, the mute crow man, who communicated through stabbing people with telepathic daggers.
> 
> The party entered the Hidden Ruins, discovering ancient Eldoran carvings and clues about shapeshifters (you found some tracks).
> 
> You started your exploration by sending Thistle to scout ahead. He found a room with pillars, a locked door with a circular recess, and inscriptions hinting at needing a key from a well. 
> 
> [[Posidonius, the Quantum Mage]], learned that the Eldorans were akin to ancient elves. 
> 
> Venturing deeper, you met a sophisticated rat who hinted at a secret apparatus to open a door. and found Aelorian's Essence.
> 
   You are currently in the room where you found this item. What do you do?
> 


(They will likely go to the room to the south)...


### Scene 1: The Pool of Water

#### Setting the Scene

> As you step into the rectangular room, you are greeted by the cool, damp air and the scent of ancient stone and earth. The room stretches before you, dimly illuminated by bioluminescent fungi clinging to the walls and ceiling, casting an eerie glow. 
> 
> Green overgrowth, including vines and moss, creeps along the stone surfaces, adding a touch of nature to the ancient, worn architecture. 
> 
> In the center of the room lies a clear pool of water, its surface perfectly still and reflecting the soft light. At the far end of the room stands an ancient well, partially obscured by moss and vines. 
> 
> Floating above the pool are **four ethereal figures**, their forms shimmering in the dim light, dressed in ancient Eldoran attire with solemn, wise expressions.
> 
> **And off in the corner you see a... rock?**
>

#### Combat Alternative

(This kills the krab...)

The ghosts appear visibly disappointed in your choice. They begin spinning rapidly around the pool. Within seconds they are spinning so fast you only see a blur of motion before... nothing at all. The wind stops. And standing before you is a beast from your darkest nightmares. A banshee. Roll for initiative.. and may Grumshar be on your side.....

#### Aelorian's Essense Speaks Up 

> **In Aelorian's voice:** "Those 4 always were a bit dramatic... You know they talked like that in life too? Weirdos... The lot of them."

### Scene 2: Returning to the Locked Door

#### Setting the Scene

> As you return to the stone slab door with the key-shaped indent, the air seems to hum with anticipation. The ancient runes on the door glow faintly, casting an eerie light on the surrounding walls. The path you traveled to reach this point is now clear in your minds, the trials and riddles of the Eldoran ghosts still fresh in your memory. 
> 
> The key you hold in your hand pulses with a soft, steady glow, matching the light of the runes on the door.
> 

#### Potential Questions and Actions

1. **How does the key fit into the door?**
    
    - **Answer**: The key fits perfectly into the circular indent in the stone slab. As it slides into place, the runes on the door begin to glow brighter, reacting to the key's presence.
2. **Is there any immediate danger or traps?**
    
    - **Perception Check (DC 14)**:
        - Success: You sense no immediate danger, but the ancient magic in the air suggests that the door is heavily warded.
        - Failure: You do not notice any immediate threats, but the sense of ancient power remains palpable.
3. **What do the runes on the door say?**
    
    - **Arcana Check (DC 15)**:
        - Success: The runes spell out a protective incantation, designed to ward off intruders. They seem to react only to the key, ensuring only those who possess it can pass.
        - Failure: The runes are indecipherable, but they glow in response to the key's presence.

#### Resolution

> As you insert the key into the door, the runes flare with a brilliant light. The stone slab begins to shift and grind, moving aside to reveal a hidden passage beyond. The air that flows through the opening is cooler and carries the faint scent of ancient, undisturbed spaces.
> 
> You step through the doorway, finding yourselves in another hallway, this one shorter and lined with more of the intricate Eldoran carvings. The path ahead is clear, leading you to the next challenge in this ancient ruin.

### Scene 3: The Guardian's Hall

#### Setting the Scene

> As you move through the newly revealed passage, you enter a hallway that opens into a larger room. This room is dimly lit by glowing crystals embedded in the walls. 
> 
> The carvings here are more elaborate, depicting scenes of Eldoran guardians standing vigil over sacred sites.
> 
> At the far end of the room, two massive figures stand motionless, their forms clearly reanimated guardians.

**Key Descriptions**:

- **Hallway**: Short and lined with detailed carvings of Eldoran guardians.
- **Large Room**: The room is expansive, with glowing crystals providing a faint light. At the far end, two reanimated guardians stand watch.

#### Potential Questions and Actions

1. **Can we identify the guardians?**
    
    - **History Check (DC 12)**:
        - Success: These are Eldoran Reanimated Guardians, often used to protect sacred places. They are formidable opponents, known for their strength and unwavering duty.
        - Failure: The guardians seem ancient and powerful, but their exact nature remains unclear.
          
2. **Are there any traps in the room?**
    
    - **Investigation Check (DC 15)**:
        - Success: You detect no physical traps, but the guardians themselves seem to be the primary defense mechanism.
        - Failure: You do not notice any traps, but the guardians' presence is foreboding.
          
3. **What is the room's significance?**
    
    - **Insight Check (DC 10)**:
        - Success: This room is clearly a final line of defense, meant to protect something of great importance deeper within the ruins.
        - Failure: The room feels important, but its exact significance is hard to discern.

### Scene 4: The Mistress's Vision

#### Setting the Scene

> As you descend the final set of stairs, the air grows colder and heavier, charged with a palpable sense of foreboding. The flickering light from the bioluminescent fungi gives way to a steady, eerie glow emanating from an ancient altar in the center of the chamber. 
> 
> Between the door and the center of the room is a semi-invisible barrier extending from floor to ceiling. It's giving off a faint purple glow... 
> 
> - https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2292-wall-of-force 
> 
> [[Posidonius, the Quantum Mage]], you immediately recognize this as a Wall of Force, 
> 
> The room itself is large, with high ceilings disappearing into darkness, and walls adorned with faded murals depicting the tragic fall of the Eldoran civilization.
> 
> Lining the walls are hundreds of stone statues of what you can only assume are Eldoran figures. 
> 
> In the middle of the room stands a glowing circle, its runes humming with residual magical energy.
> 
> The oppressive silence is broken only by the faint hum of the circle, filling you with a sense of dread and anticipation. You can't shake the feeling that you are being watched, and the weight of the Mistress's presence hangs heavily in the air.


#### Potential Questions and Actions

1. **Can we sense any immediate danger or traps?**
    
    - **Perception Check (DC 14)**:
        - Success: You sense no immediate physical danger, but the room is charged with powerful, lingering magic. The area around the circle and the circle itself are the sources of this energy.
        - Failure: The room feels oppressive and heavy with magical energy, but you do not notice any specific threats.
          


#### As you begin inspecting the circle, room, or barrier - Or as you simply walk toward the barrier... 

> **A figure appears before you.** This woman stands tall and imposing, her presence commanding the attention of all who lay eyes upon her. 
> 
> She appears as a stunningly beautiful Eldroan, her dark skin smooth and flawless, radiating an almost ethereal glow. Her long, silver hair cascades down her back in shimmering waves, framing her striking features. Her eyes are a piercing violet, reflecting a depth of ancient wisdom twisted by centuries of dark ambition. Her full lips curl into a knowing smile, hinting at the secrets she harbors.
> 
> She is dressed in a long, flowing silk robe that clings to her ample curves, accentuating her voluptuous figure. The robe is adorned with intricate golden embroidery, depicting scenes of ancient Eldoran history and symbols of power. 
> 
> The fabric shimmers as she moves, giving her an otherworldly grace. 
> 
> Around her neck, she wears a delicate silver necklace with a pendant shaped like a crescent moon, glowing faintly with magical energy.
> 
> Her hands, though elegant and slender, are tipped with long, sharp nails that gleam like polished obsidian. 
> 
> She moves with a fluid, almost hypnotic grace, each step echoing with an aura of authority and menace. Her presence is both enchanting and terrifying, a perfect blend of beauty and malevolence.
> 
> Without a any hesitation, she begins to speak. 


#### Epic monologue for the Mistress:

> "Ah, the brave travelers," she begins, her voice echoing through the chamber. "You've come far, but did you really think you could stop me? Did you think you could understand the forces at play, the delicate balance I strive to maintain?"
> 
> She steps forward, her gaze piercing through each of you.
> 
> "You see, I was there when the **world of Eldrath** Isle was torn apart, when the very fabric of our existence was ripped asunder. I witnessed the folly of the Eldoran, their arrogance and their hubris. And it was I who sought to save what remained, to weave a new future from the ashes of the old."
> 
> Her voice grows colder, filled with a steely resolve.
> 
> "But the world is stubborn, resistant to change. The people of Mystara cling to their illusions of peace and stability, blind to the lurking chaos. I have spent centuries manipulating events, guiding destinies, all to prevent the same catastrophe from happening again. And yet, you stand in my way."
> 
> She raises a hand, and the room shudders with her power.
> 
> "You may call me a monster, but I am the only one who sees the truth. The only one who understands what must be done. The destruction of Balgaran, the doppelganger attacks on your precious North Lodge—all necessary steps in my grand design. A design to save this world, even if it means sacrificing a few."
> 
> Her eyes blaze with an unholy light as she reaches the crescendo of her speech.
> 
> "You are pawns, unable to grasp the scope of my vision. But mark my words, heroes, you will not stop me. My work is far from done, and I will see it through to the end. And you will help me. Whether you know it or not."
> 
> With a dramatic flourish, she raises her arms, and a dark portal begins to form behind her.
> 
> "Farewell, Travelers. Continue your futile struggle if you must, but know that you will always be one step behind. The future of Mystara Isle is mine to shape, and I will not be denied."
> 
> As the portal engulfs her and her withered Eldoran companions, her voice lingers in the air, a chilling reminder of the darkness you face.
> 
> "And when the time comes, remember this moment. Remember that you faced the Vyra, [[The Mistress]] of Shadows; and you failed."
> 
> With that, she vanishes into the portal, leaving you in the eerie silence of the chamber, the weight of her words still linger in the air. 
> 


> **In an instant**, the statues around the room begin to shift and morph, revealing their true forms as doppelgangers. Their stone-like exteriors crack and fall away, leaving behind the menacing figures of the shapeshifters. 
> 
> Without a word, they dash towards the teleportation circle, their movements a blur of speed and agility.


### Scene 5: After The Monologue and Changeling Reveal

> As the dark portal closes behind the Mistress and her withered Eldoran companions, an eerie silence settles over the chamber. The oppressive atmosphere lingers, a reminder of the powerful presence that was just here. The players stand amidst the remnants of ancient Eldoran architecture, their minds racing with the implications of what they've just heard and witnessed.

#### Immediate Reactions

Allow the players a moment to react to the Mistress's departure. They can discuss the monologue, express their feelings, and gather their thoughts. After this brief interlude, shift the focus to the mysterious teleportation circle that the Mistress left behind.

#### Investigating the Teleportation Circle

**Perception Check (DC 13)**:
- Success: The players notice faint, shimmering runes around the edge of the circle, pulsing with residual magical energy. They can also see the faint footprints and markings indicating recent use.
- Failure: The players still notice the circle but do not see the runes or recent activity markings.


1. **What do the murals depict?**
    
    - **History Check (DC 15)**:
        - Success: The murals show the rise and fall of the Eldoran civilization, their achievements, and their ultimate downfall due to their hubris and a catastrophic event. You get the feeling that you'll be able to learn more about their history by speaking with [[Aelorian's Essence]].
        - Failure: The murals are faded and hard to decipher, but they seem to depict an ancient civilization and a great disaster.
          
2. **What is the purpose of the circle?**
    
    - **Arcana Check (DC 15)**:
		- Success: The players discern that the circle is a teleportation portal, enchanted to allow quick travel between two fixed points. The magic is ancient, likely of Eldoran origin, but has been twisted and repurposed by the Mistress.
		- Failure: The players can tell that the circle is magical but cannot determine its exact purpose or origin.
	- **History Check (DC 10)**:
		- Success: Any player with knowledge of ancient Eldoran history recalls tales of teleportation magic used for swift movement across great distances, further confirming the circle's capabilities.
		- Failure: The players miss the historical context but can still piece together the circle's function through other means.


#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **Player Question**: Can we deactivate or destroy the teleportation circle?
    
    - **Arcana Check (DC 15)**: You sense that disrupting the magical runes around the circle will render it inactive.
    - **Strength Check (DC 12)**: Physical destruction, such as smashing the runes or altar, will also work.
2. **Player Question**: Are there any clues about where the doppelgangers went?
    
    - **Investigation Check (DC 14)**: You find traces of ash and a faint, lingering energy trail that leads towards North Lodge.
3. **Player Question**: Can we find anything else in the room?
    
    - **Perception Check (DC 12)**: Hidden among the debris is a torn note fragment, possibly left behind by one of the doppelgangers, detailing their plans for an imminent attack.

**Note Fragment 9:** "...The final strike must be swift and decisive. The Mistress has decreed that North Lodge will fall tonight. All forces are to converge and eliminate any resistance..."


#### Understanding the Circle's Purpose

**Insight Check (DC 12)**:
- Success: The players realize that the circle is a crucial tool for the Mistress's minions to launch attacks on North Lodge and other targets without detection.
- Failure: The players may still understand the circle's purpose through collaborative discussion and reasoning.


#### Next Steps and Planning

Once the players understand the purpose of the circle, guide them towards deciding their next course of action:

**Purpose of the Circle**: The circle allows the Mistress's minions to teleport directly into the forest, bypassing traditional defenses.

**Next Steps**: The players must find a way to disable or disrupt the circle to stop the attacks on North Lodge. Possible options include:
- **Disrupting the Magic**: Using their own magical abilities or seeking the help of a powerful spellcaster to disrupt or deactivate the circle.
- **Physical Destruction**: Attempting to physically destroy the circle or its components, though this may require considerable effort and risk.
- **Seeking Allies**: Returning to North Lodge or another friendly settlement to gather support and resources to counteract the circle's influence.


### Scene 6: Transition: Return to Grukthar Hollow or North Lodge

> As you make your way out of the ruins, the weight of the impending threat looms over you. 
> 
> Dusk is upon you. The night will be here soon. If you hurry, you could make it to North Lodge in time to warn and help in the defense. Or you could return to the [[Grukthar Hollow]] and ask for aid. Either way, the forest is eerily quiet, the path back is filled with an oppressive tension. 
> 
> The sky darkens, and the air feels heavy with anticipation.

**Everyone Roll an Insight Check** 
(DC 10)

**North Lodge will be attacked in about 1 hour.** 
- It would take you some time to walk back to [[Grukthar Hollow]], and if you're able to convince [[Grubnar Skull-Crusher]] to help, some more time to walk back to the village. You get the feeling you would be able to get back to North Lodge in time, but just barely... 
- If you left for North Lodge right now, avoiding Grukthar Hollow entirely, you would get back to North Lodge with enough time to hopefully convince [[Darius the Retired Soldier]] and [[Gareth the Blacksmith]] and [[Miri the Carpenter]] to gather the troops and fortify where you can before the Changelings, disguised as Goblins, attack in full force. 

(DC 20)
- **Or you could split up.** Sending some back to [[Grukthar Hollow]] and some to [[North Lodge]]. 

### Scene 7a: If Returning to Grukthar Hollow 

> You arrive back at Grukthar Hollow, the goblin settlement buzzing with activity. Goblins scurry about, preparing for something unknown to them. Grubnar stands at the center, overseeing the preparations.

#### Scene: Return to Grukthar Hollow

> As you make your way out of the ruins and back into the forest, the weight of the impending threat looms over you. The forest is eerily quiet, and the path back to Grukthar Hollow is filled with an oppressive tension. You move swiftly, knowing that time is of the essence.
> 
> As you arrive back at Grukthar Hollow, the goblin settlement is buzzing with activity. Goblins scurry about, preparing for something unknown to them. Grubnar stands at the center, overseeing the preparations.

**Grukthar Hollow will help with a persuasion check success. You are asking [[Grubnar Skull-Crusher]] to put the lives of his Goblins in danger.** 
DC 30 - if the ask without explaining the situation. 
DC 20 - Explain situation with Changelings and Mistress. 
DC 15 - Remind him of his friend [[Lila Willowhart]].

**Success**: The help:
- Grubar will help. 

**Fail**: The help:
- 1 Goblin Archer, the Goblin that agreed to let them into the Cave. 

**Grubnar Dialogue:** "Krag, I need you to stay here and protect our home. If I don't make it back, you will be Chieftan. May Grumshar guide your hand."

### Scene 7b: If Returning to North Lodge: 


> As you approach North Lodge, the village is abuzz with activity. Villagers are going about their daily routines, unaware of the impending danger. The cozy cottages and bustling market stalls contrast starkly with the urgency of your mission. 
> 
> The day is winding down to a close. You see stalls starting to close and can hear mothers calling their children back inside for dinner and bed. 
> 
> You see the lights on in the inn and expect that at this time you would likely find Gareth and Miri, Lila and Darius, and maybe even Elder Thalia at the inn again. 

**The villagers will help you prepare if you pass a persuasion check.** 
DC 30 - You tell them they need to prepare, but give no further information
DC 18 - You explain the situation with Changelings and Mistress. 
DC 10 - You explain just how many changelings there are and tell them that Lila was right - the Goblins are not at fault. 

**Success**: The help:
- Darius himself will help. 
- Miri will help (if asked).

**Fail**: 
- No additional help. 

**If the players talk to Miri,** she'd mention a tinker that her and Gareth have been working on in her shop. If they ask her, she'll use it to help defend the village. 

If the players talk to Darius, he'll join the defense.

### Scene 8: The Final Defense

> As night falls, the anticipation of the attack grows. The villagers huddle behind their defenses, weapons at the ready. The flicker of torchlight in the distance signals the approach of the changeling forces.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

    - **Stealth Check (DC 14)**: Send a scout to gather information on the enemy’s movements and numbers.
      
2. **Player Question**: Are there any final preparations we can make?
