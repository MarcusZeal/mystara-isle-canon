### Timeline Recap

- **5750 B.C. (Before Cataclysm)**: - The Eldorans, a race of elves who worshipped the elements struck down their moon god, [[Lupara]]. **Lupara is dead**, which is why she has been silent for millennia. The Eldorans harvested Lupara's heart, a dense, magic infused crystal that regenerates even after Lupara's passing. 
- **5500 B.C.:** The Eldorans' master use of these blue crystals, called **Lunashards**, harvested from Lupara's heart. This lead to the Eldoran civilization expanding across the world. Their constructs and magic paved the way for thousands of years of prosperity.

- **0 B.C.**: Vyrra confronts the Thorne family, who are attempting to kill another god to harvest its power. During their battle, Lupara's Heart is struck, causing a massive explosion. The explosion eradicates the immediate area and causes a catastrophic tidal wave that plunges all but the tallest mountains underwater. This event marks the collapse of the Eldoran civilization. Vyrra is transformed into an ageless hag, and the surviving Eldorans scatter, becoming a lost legend.
