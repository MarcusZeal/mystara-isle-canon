#### The Aftermath and the Mistress’s Rise - Part 2


> "In the wake of the cataclysm, the survivors of the Eldoran race scattered, seeking refuge in the far corners of Eldrath. Our once-great civilization was no more, its remnants hidden and forgotten. The knowledge and power we had sought to control now lay dormant, waiting to be rediscovered by those who dared to seek it.
> 
> Amidst the chaos, a few Eldorans sought to reclaim what was lost. They delved into the ruins, searching for remnants of our past glory. It was during this time that a powerful mage, known only as Vyra, began to rise. She was driven by a twisted vision, believing that she alone could restore the Eldoran legacy and prevent such a catastrophe from ever occurring again.
