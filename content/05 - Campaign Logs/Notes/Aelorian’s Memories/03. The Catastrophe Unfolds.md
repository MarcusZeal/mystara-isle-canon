####  The Catastrophe Unfolds


> "The breaking point came when our most ambitious experiment went horribly awry. In our arrogance, we attempted to channel the raw essence of creation itself, to forge a new reality where we could reign as gods. But the energies we sought to control were far beyond our understanding, and the ritual unleashed a cataclysmic force that tore through Eldoria.
> 
> A rift opened, a tear in the fabric of reality, spewing forth chaos and destruction. Our great city was consumed in an instant, its towers crumbling to dust, its people annihilated. The very land beneath us trembled and cracked, reshaping the world in its wake. The Isle of Mystara, a jewel of our civilization, was shattered, its fragments scattered across the seas.
> 
> The devastation was unimaginable. Nearly the entire Eldoran race was wiped out in a single, horrific moment. Those who survived were left broken and lost, their minds shattered by the horrors they had witnessed. Our knowledge, our culture, our very essence was reduced to ruins, buried beneath the rubble of our hubris."
