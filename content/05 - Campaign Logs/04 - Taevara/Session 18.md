### Session 2: The Navy’s Shadow

### **Post-Combat Roleplay**

Once the dust settles, **Luvia Bailar** emerges from the shadows, having observed the fight. She sizes up the party and offers a sly smile:

> **Luvia’s Dialogue:**
>
> - “You lot know how to make an entrance. But you’ve also made some powerful enemies.”
> - “If you want to survive here, follow me. Bruma’s got the resources you’ll need, but he doesn’t trust easily.”

Luvia leads the party through Westara’s winding streets to meet **Mayor Cristobal Bruma**, officially kicking off their involvement in the rebellion.

---

## Key Scene 1: Meeting Cristobal Bruma

**Luvia** leads the party to **Bruma’s Villa** outside of Westara.

#### **Skill Opportunity:**

- **Perception (DC 15):** The party notices how efficiently the operation is run, with coded knocks and secret tunnels.
- **Insight (DC 16):** They sense Bruma’s pragmatic leadership style—cautious but determined.

---

### Bruma’s Dialogue Highlights:

- _“You’ve stirred the hornet’s nest. Fierros doesn’t take kindly to outsiders, especially ones who can fight back.”_
- _“The Chamber of Reflection? It’s not just a myth. But the Theocracy guards its secrets jealously.”_
- _“Help us, and we’ll help you. There’s a king waiting to reclaim the throne—and you’ll need his blessing to unlock the Chamber’s power.”_

He introduces **Taren Valen**, the boy-king, explaining his hidden lineage and destiny.

#### Additional Dialogue for **Taren Valen** and **Cristobal Bruma**

##### Cristobal Bruma: The Pragmatic Leader

Bruma is a seasoned, no-nonsense leader who cares deeply for Westara but remains wary of outsiders. His dialogue should reflect his practicality, tempered by a quiet hope for Taevara’s future.

---

**Bruma’s Initial Greeting (Post-Combat):**  
_“You’ve done well to reach Westara in one piece—and even better to knock a few dents into Taeva’s finest. But don’t get comfortable. Fierros will hear about this, and when he does, he’ll send everything he has to crush us.”_

---

**On the Theocracy’s Grip:**  
_“Taevara wasn’t always like this. Once, we were a kingdom of free people. Now, Fierros has turned the land into a prison of faith, and his Knights patrol every corner of it. If we don’t fight back, we’ll all be singing hymns at the edge of a sword.”_

---

**On the Chamber of Reflection:**  
_“The Chamber is real, and it holds power the Theocracy can’t afford to lose. They say it’s hidden high in the Mother’s Mountains, in a monastery known only to Fierros’s inner circle. If you’re looking for it, you’ll need to walk a dangerous path—and that path starts with Crownport.”_

---

**Introducing Taren Valen:**  
Bruma gestures toward a quiet figure in the room:

_“This here is Taren Valen, though his name doesn’t mean much yet. He’s the rightful heir to Taevara’s throne, a lineage the Theocracy has worked hard to bury. If we’re going to break Fierros’s hold on the land, it’ll be with him leading the charge.”_

---

**On the Party’s Role:**  
_“You’ve got your own mission, but make no mistake—you’re part of this fight now. Help us restore the monarchy, and we’ll give you what you need to reach the Chamber. Refuse, and I’d start planning your escape from Vodari, because Fierros won’t stop hunting you.”_

---

##### Taren Valen: The Reluctant Heir

Taren is a reserved, unassuming teenager, suddenly thrust into the role of king. He carries the weight of expectation but lacks confidence in his ability to lead. His dialogue reflects a mix of humility, doubt, and quiet determination.

---

**Taren’s Initial Greeting:**  
_Taren hesitates before speaking, his voice quiet but steady._

_“I’m not much to look at, I know. Bruma says I’m a king, but I don’t feel like one. Not yet.”_

---

**On the Theocracy’s Rule:**  
_“I’ve seen what Fierros does to people who stand against him. Families broken, villages burned. Sometimes I wonder if we can really change anything.”_

---

**On His Destiny:**  
_“Everyone keeps telling me I have a duty—to reclaim the throne, to free Taevara. I’ll do it, but not because it’s expected of me. I’ll do it because it’s right.”_

---

**When Asked About His Skills:**  
_Taren smiles faintly, a bit self-deprecating._

_“I can hold my own in a fight, and I know my way around the woods. But leading an army? Rallying a kingdom? That’s going to take time... and people like you.”_

---

##### Closing Scene Dialogue

**Bruma’s Final Words of the Session:**

The sides of this upcoming war have been set for a generation... split by the Mother's Mountains... and it seems like Taeva smiles upon our side of the mountains by giving us you. Whether or not she's smiling out of smite or compassion is to be seen I suppose...

Rest up, but not too long. The Navy will be back in the morning... and after todays antics, I expect they'll be sending Agholor himself... His honor that he holds so dear will cause many of the less-than savory people of Westara to lose their lives. This I have no doubt.

**Taren’s Closing Note:**  
_“You’ve already done more than most would dare. If we stand together, maybe we really can give Taevara its future back.”_

---

### Zephyr's Awakening Montage

For the next fiveday you're all able to explore the Westara and get a feel of the land. During this time, the following interaction happens to Zephyr.

---

**DM Monologue: Zephyr's Transformation**

> _"Voda! You seemed to be interested in that black powder we have on the docks. Take this musket. I think it will suit you better than those old swords you seem to be floundering with."_
>
> Luvia’s words echo in your mind as you hold the musket in your hands. It’s crude by your standards—a relic of desperate rebellion rather than a masterpiece of engineering—but there’s potential here. And potential, you realize, is where you thrive.
>
> That night, in the quiet of your quarters, you begin to study the weapon with an obsessive intensity. The weight of the musket feels natural in your hands, as if it had been waiting for you all along. You disassemble it under the glow of a single candle, the scent of oil and black powder mixing with the salt air of Westara. Each piece tells a story: the care of its maker, the desperation of its user, the untapped possibilities of its design.
>
> Your mind races, schematics forming in your imagination as if guided by unseen hands. You scavenge parts from the rebellion’s supplies—scraps of brass, a few tempered springs, and a shard of enchanted steel. With delicate precision, you craft a repeating mechanism, inscribing subtle runes of magical reinforcement along the barrel.
>
> When you test the newly infused musket at dawn, the sound is different. The recoil is smoother, the accuracy sharper. It doesn’t just fire—it sings.
>
> Over the next few days, your nights are restless and your days consumed by training. Luvia introduces you to the shadowed streets and hidden alleys of Westara, where you move like the wraiths you once hunted, unseen and silent. She teaches you to use the darkness, not to hide, but to dominate—how to blend into the void and strike before your enemy even knows you’re there.
>
> You experiment with the musket in this shrouded world, firing from impossible angles and retreating before the echo fades. Each shot feels like an extension of your will, a perfect union of engineering and instinct.
>
> In the darkest hours before dawn, something changes. The shadows themselves seem to reach out for you, wrapping around you like an old friend. Your vision sharpens in the dim light, and your movements grow faster, more deliberate. You feel a primal connection to the night—a bond not born of fear, but of mastery. You feel the curse of lycanthropy lifted. Your old maledict and Hunter's Bane forgotten... transformed somehow.
>
> On the final evening of your training, you perch on the rooftop of an old warehouse, musket in hand, watching as Taevaran patrols march below. The night is your ally now, its silence a weapon more powerful than any blade. With each breath, you feel the blend of your artificer’s precision and your newfound hunter’s instincts. You are no longer Zephyr, the swordsman who struggled to find his place...
>
> You are a Gloom Stalker, a shadow in the night, a predator with a weapon that bridges magic and innovation. The rebellion’s enemies will never see you coming.

**It's been 5 days since that scuffle on the docks. What did the rest of you do during that time?**

...

## Key Scene 2: Naval Crackdown

---

#### **Present Scene: The Crackdown at the Docks**

> _"The air feels heavier today. Market stalls sit half-empty, and the usual clamor of the docks has given way to anxious silence. The smell of salt and damp wood mingles with an undercurrent of fear. Fewer smugglers roam the streets, and more frightened faces dart glances toward the harbor."_

The party hears the distant sound of disciplined boots striking cobblestone. As they approach the docks, a grim scene unfolds:

- Navy soldiers have formed a tight perimeter, corralling locals like cattle.
- Smugglers are dragged from hiding places and thrown into chains.
- First Knight **Varrek** stands at the center of the chaos, his gleaming plate armor marred by signs of repair from their last encounter. His demeanor remains calm and measured, but there is a visible tension in his posture.

---

**Insight** Check (DC18)

- 15 - Varrek' heart doesn't seem to be in it...
- 18 - It looks like Varrek might be there specifically looking for you.
- 26 - Varrek' eyes keep darting to the watch tower.

**Varrek’s Address to the Party:**

Spotting the party, Varrek calls off his men, his voice carrying over the clamor:

> _“Stand down, soldiers. These are no ordinary foes—they’ve shown us that before.”_

Varrek approaches the party slowly, his hand resting on the hilt of his longsword. He pauses a short distance away, meeting their eyes with a calm but weighty expression.

> _“You are merciful, I’ll grant you that. Few would bother to mend the wounds of an enemy in retreat. Fewer still would free a prisoner at great personal risk.”_

His tone darkens slightly, though there is no malice:

> _“You showed compassion to Theadora, despite not knowing her truth. A noble act, though I wonder if you will regret it when mercy becomes your undoing.”_

---

#### **Varrek’s Offer**

Rather than ordering an attack, Varrek tilts his head, studying the party.

> _“Taeva teaches us that light must temper shadow, and even in the darkest hearts, light can be found. Perhaps there is a chance for understanding between us yet. Surrender now, and I will see to it you are treated with dignity. Or, continue to oppose Taeva’s will, and my soldiers will have no choice but to act...”_

---

#### **Party’s Options**

The party now has a chance to shape the interaction:

- **Diplomacy (Persuasion DC 17):** Convince Varrek to disengage, citing their previous mercy and questioning the Navy’s heavy-handed methods. If successful, Varrek orders a temporary retreat, though he warns that this does not absolve the party of their perceived crimes.
- **Deception (DC 15):** Distract Varrek or mislead him about their intentions to buy time or avoid confrontation.

---

##### ...Outcomes of the Encounter\*\*

In either outcome of diplomacy or combat, Varrek will do and say the following either immediately upon his turn, after being attacked, or upon diplomatic success.

> **Varrek looks to the crowded streets of Westara.** "Alas... Another battle on these docks would not be wise. There are too many civilians of Taeva here that could be caught up in the crossfire. We are not your enemy by choice, but by necessity and I fear that one day your mercy may falter...
>
> Men, we're leaving. Our mission today was to round up all the traitors to Taeva. We found none. Back to the ship. Now."
>
> **As Varrek turns to leave, he makes eye contact with Percy before looking directly at the old guard tower.**

---

#### **Aftermath**

The battle took many lives. Westara saw 6 civilians murdered by Taevara navy. The navy took heavy casualities in return, however.

From the corpses of the fallen, the party took:

> 3 sets of plate
> 2 mace
> 3 quarterstaff
> 3 halberds
> 3 crossbows

**Varrek is now with the party, reporting back to Bruma's Villa.**
