### **Back at Bruma’s Villa**

The party reports their encounter to Bruma, who listens intently.

---

**Bruma’s Dialogue:**

> _“Varrek is no fool, nor is he a heartless man. That makes him all the more dangerous. If he doubts the Theocracy, then we might turn him—or at least make his role in this conflict more complicated.”_

Bruma leans back, steepling his fingers.

> _“But doubts won’t stop Fierros, and they won’t stop the Navy. We need to make sure Westara’s factions are ready to resist, no matter what comes next.”_

### Expanded Session 3: Building the Rebellion  

---

**Objective:** Solidify the party’s involvement in the Westaran resistance by uniting its factions, executing crucial sabotage missions, and defending Taren Valen from an assassination attempt.  

---

### **Opening Scene: Rallying the Resistance**  

The session begins with Bruma addressing the party in his hidden chamber. He outlines the need to strengthen Westara’s unity and resistance before they can challenge the Theocracy or make any progress toward the Chamber of Reflection.  

---

**Bruma’s Dialogue:**  
_“Westara is a city of defiance, but defiance alone won’t save us. The smugglers, rebels, and common folk all have their own fights. If we can’t bring them together, Fierros will crush us before we ever reach Crownport.”_  

_“We’ve got three fires to put out—or stoke, depending on how you see it. And one more thing: our boy-king might not live to see his throne unless we act fast.”_  

---

### **Key Scene 1: Uniting the Factions**  

The party must approach three key groups—smugglers, rebels, and common folk—to unify Westara’s resistance. Each group has its own leader, motivations, and grievances.  

---

#### **1. Smugglers**  
Leader: **Luvia Bailar**  

- **Mission:** The smugglers refuse to work together, suspicious of outsiders and rivals. Luvia tasks the party with brokering a truce between two feuding smuggler gangs.  
- **Skill Challenge:**  
  - **Persuasion/Intimidation (DC 18):** Convince the leaders to negotiate.  
  - **Insight (DC 15):** Identify underlying tensions and propose fair terms.  
  - **Stealth (DC 17):** Eavesdrop on their operations to gain leverage.  
- **Outcome:** Success earns the party the smugglers’ loyalty and opens up Westara’s black market resources.  

---

#### **2. Rebels**  
Leader: **Darius Ironshade** (LN Male Half-Orc, Rebel Commander)  

- **Mission:** The rebels need weapons and supplies. Darius asks the party to raid a Taevaran armory.  
- **Combat Encounter:**  
  - The armory is guarded by 4 Taevaran Knights (CR 5) and 1 Mage (CR 6).  
  - Environmental Hazards: Explosive barrels can be used strategically.  
- **Outcome:** Victory equips the rebels with superior arms, bolstering their morale and readiness.  

---

#### **3. Common Folk**  
Leader: **Mira Lanson** (NG Female Human, Community Organizer)  

- **Mission:** The people of Westara are fearful and hesitant to act. Mira asks the party to inspire them by defending a local district from a Taevaran patrol.  
- **Roleplay Opportunity:**  
  - The party speaks to the townsfolk, rallying them through words or demonstrations of strength.  
  - **Performance or Persuasion (DC 15):** Stir the crowd into action.  
  - **Outcome:** The common folk pledge their support, providing shelter, food, and information networks.  

---

### **Key Scene 2: Sabotage Missions**  

Once the factions are united, Bruma offers the party optional sabotage missions to weaken the Taevaran Navy’s grip on Westara. These missions can be woven into downtime or used to build momentum for the rebellion.  

**Examples:**  
1. **Sink a Taevaran Warship:** Infiltrate the naval docks and plant explosives.  
2. **Intercept a Supply Caravan:** Ambush a convoy transporting rations and weapons.  
3. **Spread Disinformation:** Forge letters to sow distrust among Taevaran ranks.  

Each success reduces the Theocracy’s ability to retaliate, creating strategic advantages for the rebellion.  

---

### **Key Scene 3: Assassination Attempt on Taren Valen**  

As the rebellion gains momentum, High Priest Alcanta sends an elite assassin to eliminate **Taren Valen**.  

---

#### **Setting:**  
The party returns to Bruma’s stronghold to find chaos. Guards lie unconscious, and Taren is missing.  

**Description:**  
_“The hidden chamber is a mess of overturned tables and spilled ink. Bruma paces furiously, shouting orders. ‘Taren’s gone! They took him—alive, at least. There’s still time.’”_  

---

#### **Chase or Rescue Encounter:**  

The party must track down and stop the assassin before Taren is executed.  

- **Skill Challenge:**  
  - **Survival (DC 16):** Track the assassin through Westara’s labyrinthine streets.  
  - **Perception (DC 15):** Spot signs of struggle or Taren’s whereabouts.  
  - **Athletics/Acrobatics (DC 14):** Navigate rooftops or crowded alleys to close the gap.  

#### **Combat Encounter:**  
- **Elite Assassin (CR 9):** A deadly foe armed with poison and shadow-based abilities.  
- **2 Shadow Enforcers (CR 6 each):** Stealthy backup fighters with high mobility.  

**Climactic Moment:** The party rescues Taren just as the assassin prepares to deliver a fatal blow.  

---

### **Ending the Session**  

With Taren safe but shaken, Bruma gathers the party.  

**Bruma’s Dialogue:**  
_“Alcanta won’t stop until Taren is dead. But this attack proves one thing—they’re scared. Fierros knows his time is running out, and so do his lackeys.”_  

The session ends with Bruma outlining the next steps: the party must extract critical intel from High Priestess Jaya in Crownport.  

---

### Key Outcomes:  
- The party successfully unites Westara’s factions.  
- The rebellion’s strength increases, setting up future large-scale operations.  
- Taren survives the assassination attempt, reinforcing the importance of his role in Taevara’s future.  
- High Priest Alcanta is established as a ruthless secondary antagonist.
