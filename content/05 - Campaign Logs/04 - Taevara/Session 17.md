## Arrival in Westara  

---

**Objective:** The party lands on Vodari, but their arrival doesn’t go unnoticed. They face a brutal Taevaran Navy patrol, setting a tense tone and immediately pushing them into Westara’s rebellion.  

---

### **Monologue Transition**  

Set the stakes high from the start:  

_"After weeks of treacherous sailing, dodging storms and patrols, you finally spot the jagged coast of Westara. As your ship glides into a bustling harbor, a sense of uneasy freedom fills the air. But peace is fleeting. Before you can even disembark, the heavy tread of armored boots echoes across the docks."_  

---

### **Opening Scene: Dockside Confrontation**  

**Set the Tone:**  
- The party’s ship pulls into Westara’s harbor, where smuggling vessels and colorful merchant ships mingle. The mood is immediately shattered by the arrival of a heavily armed Taevaran Navy patrol.  

**Taevaran Navy Patrol Composition:**  
- **Captain Varrek (CR 9):** A seasoned commander with an enchanted longsword and powerful combat maneuvers.  He is morally conflicted. His orders seem wrong, but he's always followed orders. 
- **4 Taevaran Elite Knights (CR 5 each):** Highly trained soldiers wielding halberds and heavy shields, with tactical group abilities.  
- **2 Acolytes of Taeva (CR 2 each):** Provide divine support, using spells like **Spirit Guardians**, **Mass Healing Word**, and **Bless**.  
- **1 Arcane Inquisitor (CR 7):** A mage trained to suppress arcane threats. Casts spells like **Counterspell**, **Fireball**, and **Shield**.  


> _As the sound of boots striking wood reverberates across the docks, Captain Varrek steps forward, his voice cold and authoritative._  
> 
> **Varrek:**  
> _"Men! The High Theocracy has decreed that Westara harbors heresy and treason. Our task is clear."_  
> 
> _“Search every vessel. Seize the cargo. And if you find any smugglers, bring them to me—alive, if possible. Their confessions will fuel Taeva’s justice.”_  
> 
> _(He glances over the crowd, eyes narrowing as he spots the party disembarking.)_  
> 
> _"You there! No one escapes Taeva’s light. You have reached Taevara's shores - a proud Theocracy to Taeva. If you're traveling with contraband of any kind, I will have to ask you to hand it over to the church immediately."_


> .....


> "I see... Well then... may your judgement be swift and may Taeva smile upon us for carrying out justice. Men... to me."
> 
> **Knight’s Acknowledgment:**  
> The Taevaran Elite Knights salute in unison, their halberds clanging against their shields.  
>
> **Knights (in unison):**  
> _"For Taeva!"_

### **Combat Encounter: Deadly Dock Battle**  

#### **Battlefield Dynamics:**  
- **Crates, Barrels, and Moored Ships:** Provide cover and elevation opportunities.  
- **Crowds of Civilians:** Create difficult terrain in some areas as panicked civilians flee.  
- **Dockside Water Hazards:** Any creature knocked prone near the edge risks falling into the sea.  

#### **Combat Tactics:**  
- **Captain Varrek**: Leads from the front, using tactical maneuvers to knock party members off balance. He uses **Commanding Strike** to enable allies to strike out of turn.  
- **Elite Knights**: Form a defensive phalanx, using **Shove** to push characters toward the water or isolate weaker targets.  
- **Acolytes of Taeva**: Maintain **Spirit Guardians** around their group, forcing the party to think carefully about positioning.  
- **Arcane Inquisitor**: Focuses on suppressing magic users in the party, using **Counterspell** and **Fireball** to disrupt and punish grouped players.  

#### **Additional Threats:**  
- **Reinforcements:** If the party appears to be handling the encounter too easily, a second wave of **3 Taevaran Knights (CR 5)** can arrive on the dock within 3 rounds.

### **Combat Climax: The Captain’s Orders**  

> **Varrek’s Retreat Command:**
> 
> Varrek stumbles slightly, blood seeping through the cracks in his armor. His expression hardens as he grips his enchanted longsword tightly.
> 
> **Varrek:**  
> _"Fall back! We’ve done what we can here—live to fight another day."_  
> _“Knights, form a defensive line! Cover our retreat!”_
> 
> (As he steps back toward an escape route, he glares at the party, his voice carrying both anger and a hint of reluctant respect.)
> 
> **Varrek:**  
> _"This isn’t over. The Mother’s light will find you, no matter where you run."_
> 
> **To his Inquisitor:**  
> _"Inquisitors - Suppress them! Ensure our exit!"_
