### Expanded Ritual Details: The Lunashard Ascension

#### **The Ritual Overview**
The ritual, referred to as the **"Lunashard Ascension,"** is a dangerous and blasphemous ceremony designed to merge the divine energy of Taeva with the volatile power of Lunashards. The ritual seeks to grant Archpriest Fierros unparalleled divine power, effectively elevating him to a near-deity status within Taevara's faith. However, the ritual risks catastrophic repercussions for the land, including widespread corruption and destruction.

#### **Purpose and Objectives**
1. **Fierros’s Goals:**
   - Fierros believes Taeva has chosen him to become a living avatar of the divine, uniting the fragmented Taevaran faith under his singular, uncompromising vision.
   - He is driven by the belief that the power of Lunashards represents Taeva’s will made manifest.
   - The ritual is not just about power but about purging what Fierros views as heretical factions and cleansing Vodari of its chaos.

2. **Alcanta’s Hidden Agenda:**
   - High Priest Alcanta, outwardly loyal to Fierros, secretly plans to sabotage the ritual and seize the power for himself. He views Fierros’s faith as misguided zealotry and intends to twist the ritual to create his own conduit to the dark deity Vesi.
   - Alcanta uses his access to resources and knowledge to manipulate key elements of the ritual, embedding contingencies that serve his ambition while keeping his intentions hidden from Fierros.

#### **Ritual Mechanics**
1. **Lunashard Power:**
   - Lunashards contain raw magical energy capable of altering the weave of reality. Fierros’s plans involve fusing this power with divine magic through ancient rites.
   - If improperly harnessed, Lunashards can corrupt their surroundings, creating zones of magical instability or even ripping open portals to other planes.

2. **Sacred Sites:**
   - The ritual must take place at a **Celestial Nexus**, a location where divine energy naturally converges. Fierros has identified one such site deep within the ruins of an ancient Taevaran temple, **The Sanctum of the Azure Flame.**
   - The nexus amplifies magical energies, ensuring the Lunashard’s power can be infused into the ritual caster.

3. **Components and Stages:**
   - **Stage 1:** Ritual preparation, requiring sacrifices of "faithless heretics." Their blood symbolically represents a cleansing of impurities. These sacrifices are why Sandis’s raids on smugglers and resistors have escalated.
   - **Stage 2:** Infusion of Lunashard energy into the ritual focus, a **Divine Prism**, an artifact capable of channeling immense magical power.
   - **Stage 3:** Fierros serves as the primary caster, invoking Taeva’s name to bind divine power with Lunashard magic. Alcanta, acting as a secondary caster, secretly manipulates the weave to create a backdoor for his own ambitions.

4. **Potential Consequences:**
   - If successful, Fierros would gain godlike powers, potentially reshaping Taevara’s faith and Vodari itself in his image.
   - If disrupted or corrupted (intentionally or otherwise), the ritual could unleash catastrophic magical fallout:
     - **Uncontrolled Corruption:** Lunashard energy mutates the land and people into monstrous forms.
     - **Planar Breaches:** Rifts to chaotic or infernal planes open, unleashing hordes of otherworldly creatures.
     - **Death of the Nexus:** The Celestial Nexus is destroyed, cutting off divine magic in the region entirely.

#### **Fierros and Alcanta’s Roles**
- **Archpriest Fierros:**
  - The mastermind of the ritual, Fierros directs the logistics and preparation.
  - He remains devout, believing his success is ordained by Taeva, and he sees Alcanta as an indispensable ally.
  - Fierros is unaware of Alcanta’s duplicity but has grown suspicious of minor inconsistencies in his behavior.

- **High Priest Alcanta:**
  - Alcanta oversees the acquisition of Lunashards and manages logistical details that allow him to secretly alter the ritual's mechanics.
  - He uses coded orders and secret communications to ensure his manipulation goes unnoticed.
  - Alcanta plans to execute his betrayal at the height of the ritual, either killing Fierros outright or using the unstable Lunashard energy to subvert the ritual to Vesi’s design.

#### **Clues for the Party to Discover**
1. **Scroll with Orders:** The sealed scroll from Fierros contains explicit instructions about the location and purpose of the ritual but omits key details that Alcanta has withheld.
2. **Alcanta’s Cipher:** A coded journal or correspondence hints at a betrayal, referencing Vesi’s name and the corrupted potential of Lunashards.
3. **Ritual Schematics:** Found in Fierros’s quarters or a related temple, detailing the stages of the ritual and the importance of the Celestial Nexus.

#### **Foreshadowing Future Conflict**
- **The Party’s Role:** Whether they aim to disrupt the ritual or exploit the rift between Fierros and Alcanta, their actions will influence the outcome.
- **Sandis Agholor’s Involvement:** As a conflicted figure, Sandis may uncover Alcanta’s treachery and be forced to choose sides.
- **Potential Outcomes:**
  - Fierros’s ascension, leading to a tyrannical theocracy.
  - Alcanta’s betrayal, plunging Taevara into chaos and summoning forces of Vesi.
  - Complete ritual failure, unleashing catastrophic magical fallout on Vodari.
