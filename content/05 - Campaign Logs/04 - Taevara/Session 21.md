### Expanded Session 5: Infiltrating Crownport  

---

**Objective:** Enter Crownport covertly, gain the trust of key allies, and infiltrate **Taeva’s Crown** to uncover the Chamber’s location. This session sets up the danger and intrigue of Crownport, with high stakes as Fierros’s forces close in.  

---

### **Opening Scene: Arrival in Crownport**  

**Description:**  
_“Crownport looms ahead, its spires and cathedral towers gleaming under the sun. The city’s grandeur masks its oppressive soul—streets lined with stern-faced clerics, heavily armored knights at every corner, and banners bearing Taeva’s sigil fluttering in the wind. The weight of the Theocracy is felt in every step, every hushed conversation.”_

  - **Deception (DC 16):** Convince guards at the gates they are simple pilgrims or merchants.  
  - **Performance (DC 14):** Act the part, mirroring the subdued demeanor of Crownport’s citizens.  
  - **Insight (DC 15):** Identify the behaviors and cues that will keep them from drawing suspicion.

#### **1. Marco Cincel (Spy for Westara)**

- **Marco’s Personality:** Quietly confident, observant, and always speaking in veiled terms.  
- **Meeting Marco:**  
  _“Ah, travelers. You’ve arrived at an interesting time. The winds of change blow even here, though few care to notice.”_

#### **2. Sir Xavier Casta (Disillusioned Knight)**  

**Location:** A secluded training yard near **Taeva’s Shield**, the Knights’ headquarters.  

- **Xavier’s Personality:** Stoic, honorable, but deeply conflicted. He questions the Theocracy’s methods but fears openly defying them.  
- **Meeting Xavier:**  
  _“Taeva’s light does not blind me as it once did. I see the shadows now, cast by those who claim to serve her. If you seek the truth, tread carefully—it is a dangerous path.”_  

**Skill Challenge:**

- **Persuasion (DC 17):** Appeal to his sense of justice, urging him to aid the resistance.

### **Key Scene 2: Infiltrating Taeva’s Crown**  

With intel from Marco and Xavier, the party plans their infiltration of **Taeva’s Crown**, the grand cathedral and seat of Fierros’s power.

#### **Climactic Moment: Discovering the Chamber’s Location**  

The party uncovers a hidden archive within the cathedral, containing detailed records about the **Chamber of Reflection**.  

**Evidence:**  
- A map showing the monastery’s location high in the **Mother’s Mountains**.  
- Ritual instructions suggesting Fierros plans to use the Chamber’s trials to harness the Lunashards’ power for godhood.  

**Complication:**  
As the party retrieves this information, an alarm is triggered, summoning **elite knights** and **Fierros’s personal guard**.  

---

### **Key Scene 3: Escape or Confrontation**  

The party must decide whether to fight their way out or use the secret tunnels mapped by Marco to escape.  

---

#### **Combat Encounter (Optional):**  
If the party chooses to stand and fight:  
- **2 Elite Knights (CR 7):** Highly disciplined and deadly in close quarters.  
- **1 Inquisitor (CR 8):** Uses spells like **Hold Person** and **Counterspell** to control the fight.

If they opt to flee, they must navigate the tunnels while being pursued.  
- **Athletics (DC 14):** Outrun or outmaneuver their pursuers.  
- **Survival (DC 15):** Navigate the labyrinthine tunnels without getting lost.

### **Ending the Session: Fierros Takes Notice**  

Whether the party escapes or confronts their pursuers, the session concludes with a chilling note:  

**Fierros’s Message:**  
_“You think you’ve uncovered my plans, but you’re already too late. The Chamber of Reflection will bow to my will, and with it, so will all of Taevara. Come if you dare—you’ll find only your end.”_  

---

### Key Outcomes:  
- The party gains the precise location of the Chamber of Reflection.  
- Fierros becomes aware of their interference, raising the stakes for the rebellion.  
- The stage is set for their next mission: escaping Crownport and returning to Westara.
