### Expanded Session 6: Escaping Crownport  

---

**Objective:** The party must escape Crownport with critical information about the Chamber of Reflection while evading fierce pursuit from the Taevaran Navy and Knights.  

---

### **Opening Scene: The Alarm is Raised**  

The session begins immediately after the events of Session 5. The party has just uncovered the location of the Chamber of Reflection in **Taeva’s Crown** and triggered an alarm. They must now make a swift and strategic exit.  

---

**Description:**  
_“The cathedral’s bells toll in rapid succession, their sound cutting through the still night air. Heavy boots pound the marble floors as shouts echo through the corridors. Outside, the city is stirring—knights rallying to arms, patrols doubling their routes, and ships in the harbor preparing for pursuit.”_  

---

### **Key Scene 1: Escape Through the City**  

The party has two primary escape routes:  

---

#### **Option 1: Underground Networks**  

Marco Cincel provided the party with maps of secret tunnels beneath Crownport. These lead to Westara but are treacherous and lightly guarded.  

**Skill Challenge:**  
- **Survival (DC 15):** Navigate the tunnels without getting lost.  
- **Stealth (DC 16):** Avoid or silently dispatch small patrols stationed in key areas.  
- **Investigation (DC 14):** Locate hidden passages or trap mechanisms left by smugglers.  

**Complication:**  
The tunnels are unstable, and sections may collapse. If the party fails a skill check, they face hazards such as falling debris or flooding.  

---

#### **Option 2: Commandeering a Ship from Taeva’s Arms**  

If the party opts for a bold escape, they can infiltrate the heavily guarded naval docks and steal a ship.  

**Skill Challenge:**  
- **Stealth (DC 17):** Avoid detection as they navigate the docks.  
- **Deception (DC 15):** Pose as dockworkers or officers to gain access to a ship.  
- **Thieves’ Tools (DC 16):** Disable harbor chains or unlock a secured vessel.  

**Complication:**  
Once they commandeer a ship, a naval pursuit ensues. They must outmaneuver or disable pursuing ships using clever tactics and environmental hazards like reefs or fog banks.  

---

### **Key Scene 2: Pursuit by Admiral Mirabella Roas**  

Regardless of their escape route, **Admiral Mirabella Roas** is hot on their trail. Known for her relentless tactics and unyielding loyalty to Fierros, she commands a fleet or leads an elite force underground to intercept the party.  

---

#### **Combat Encounter: Mirabella’s Elite Force**  

If the party engages in combat during their escape:  

- **Admiral Mirabella Roas (CR 10):** A battle-hardened tactician with storm-based abilities, wielding a cutlass and commanding her troops with deadly efficiency.  
- **2 Elite Marines (CR 7):** Skilled fighters specializing in ranged combat and boarding maneuvers.  
- **2 Inquisitors (CR 8):** Spellcasters who focus on disabling the party with spells like **Hold Person**, **Counterspell**, and **Wall of Force**.  

**Mirabella’s Dialogue (During Combat):**  
_“You’ve stolen from Taeva’s chosen! You will not leave this city alive. Prepare to face the sea’s wrath!”_  

---

#### **Skill Challenge: Naval Chase (If at Sea)**  

If they escape by ship, a high-stakes chase ensues:  

- **Athletics (DC 14):** Maintain control of their ship in rough waters or avoid obstacles.  
- **Perception (DC 16):** Spot incoming threats, such as enemy cannon fire or approaching ships.  
- **Arcana (DC 15):** Use magical means to enhance their speed or create obstacles for their pursuers.  

**Complication:**  
Mirabella’s ship is faster and heavily armed. The party must disable her flagship or use the environment (e.g., narrow channels, fog) to evade capture.  

---

### **Key Scene 3: Final Escape to Westara**  

The party narrowly escapes Crownport and returns to Westara, bringing with them the location of the Chamber of Reflection. They are battered but victorious.  

---

### **Ending the Session: Debrief with Bruma**  

Back in Westara, Bruma and Luvia await their return.  

**Bruma’s Dialogue:**  
_“You made it back. And with the location of the Chamber, no less. Fierros won’t take this lightly—he’ll send everything he has after us now. But we’ve got our path forward.”_  

**Luvia’s Dialogue:**  
_“Mirabella’s not the type to give up. You’ve humiliated her, and she’ll come back with a vengeance. Let’s make sure we’re ready.”_  

**Cliffhanger:** As the party prepares for their next mission to the **Mother’s Mountains**, a messenger arrives with dire news: Fierros has begun mobilizing his forces toward the mountains. Time is running out.  

---

### Key Outcomes:  
- The party successfully escapes Crownport, bringing vital intel back to Westara.  
- **Admiral Mirabella Roas** is established as a formidable foe, potentially recurring in future encounters.  
- The stage is set for the trek to the **Chamber of Reflection** in the next session.
