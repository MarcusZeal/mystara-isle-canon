### Narrative Recap


> The adventurers ventured into the ancient ruins, encountering Ren, a turtle-like being, and Sylvain, an elf who had been trapped in the ruins trying to solve a riddle. Ren introduced himself, confused and hesitant about his new form. Sylvain, having spent considerable time deciphering the ruins' secrets, welcomed the newcomers and shared his knowledge. Eldric and Thistle, however, were initially skeptical of Ren and tested his resilience in a playful scuffle. Posidonius approached the ethereal figures hovering above the pool to gather clues for the riddle.
> 
> The group faced the ghosts' riddles, each representing an elemental force. Despite some incorrect guesses, Sylvain's quick thinking led him to shout all the elemental names at once. This action caused the ghosts to speak over each other, revealing the answers. The ghosts acknowledged the adventurers' wisdom and granted them the key to proceed. With this new information, the group felt a surge of accomplishment and unity, strengthening their resolve to face the dangers ahead.
> 
> The adventurers entered the Guardian's Hall, a dimly lit room guarded by two massive reanimated guardians. Using their wits, they devised a plan to turn the guardians against each other by throwing rocks between them, causing confusion and rage. The Guardians, mistaking the rocks for intruders, attacked in the direction of the rock... hitting and doing damage to their counterpart. The party watched as the guardians destroyed each other, allowing them to proceed without a harmful direct confrontation.
> 
> Descending into the final chamber, the adventurers were confronted by the Mistress of Shadows, Vyrra. Her imposing presence and chilling monologue revealed her plans to control the Isle and prevent another cataclysm. Sylvain, realizing the imminent threat, sprinted back to North Lodge to seek help. He navigated through the Goblin Cave, pleading with Grubnar for aid. The urgency in his voice and the dire situation convinced the goblin leader to assist in the defense of North Lodge.
> 
> Meanwhile, the rest of the party worked to overcharge the arcane runes on the ground. Their efforts created an unstable, temporary portal back to North Lodge. As they stepped through, the portal collapsed, causing the ruins to implode. The heroes narrowly escaped, emerging in North Lodge to the sound of alarms and hurried preparations. The townspeople, seeing the urgency in the adventurers' eyes, rallied to help defend their home from the impending attack.
> 
> The adventurers spread throughout North Lodge, urging the villagers to arm themselves and prepare for battle. They explained the threat of the Changelings and Barghests, convincing even the skeptical to take action. Darius and Miri fortified the walls, setting up defensive positions. Miri, with a hint of mischief, revealed a flamethrower turret she had been working on with Gareth, promising it would "heat things up." Gareth joined forces with Azzika, Garos, and Syrain at a different outpost, ready to fend off the attackers.
> 
> As night fell, the changeling forces, led by Barghests, began their assault on North Lodge. The villagers, now armed and prepared, fought valiantly alongside the adventurers. Darius demonstrated his combat prowess, leading the trainees by example. The flamethrower turret, manned by Miri, proved to be a game-changer, scorching the attacking forces. Garos, now fully embracing his new form and abilities, fought fiercely, protecting his newfound home. The battle was intense, but the combined efforts of the townspeople and adventurers led to a hard-fought victory, ensuring the safety of North Lodge and thwarting the Mistress's plans... at least for now.

**Celebration**

### The Journey to Eboncrest

**Departure**

> The next morning, you gather your supplies and set off towards Eboncrest. The road ahead is long, spanning three days of travel through varied terrain.

#### Day 1:  Aelorian Speaks

- As the party ventures through a tranquil forest glade, the magical necklace suddenly begins to glow and hum. 
- The air around them seems to still, and a voice emanates from the necklace.



![[01. The Golden Age of the Eldorans]]


**When Asked About Their Role:**
> "Listen, yous are the prophesied heroes, alright? Summoned here to set things right. It ain’t just about your strength; it’s about workin’ together, understandin’ the big picture. You gotta stop Vyrra and save Mystara from another disaster. No pressure, right?"

**When Asked About the Necklace:**
> "I’m Aelorian, bound to this here necklace by some powerful ancient magic. I got all the knowledge and memories of the Eldorans. Use what I know wisely, cause the fate of Mystara might just depend on it. Now, let’s get to work, huh?"

**When Asked About the Mistress:**
> "Ah, Vyrra, yeah? She was one of us, a real hotshot mage back in the day. She tried to stop some big catastrophe, but it all went sideways, ya know? Now she’s this twisted hag, thinkin’ she’s gotta control everything to keep the world from fallin’ apart again. Her heart's in the right place sure, but her methods? Fuhgeddaboudit."

**"How many questions will you answer in a day?"**
>  "Look, I got my limits, alright? I can handle a few questions a day, but don’t go overboard. Too much jabberin’ wears me out."

**"Why are you so talkative right now?"**
>  "Heh, I’m in a good mood, I guess. You’ve been doin’ some good work, and I figured it’s time you learned a bit more about what’s goin’ on."

**"What should we know about the Dragonspire Mountains?"**
> "Those mountains are no joke. Dangerous creatures, ancient ruins, and harsh weather. But you’ll find some powerful magic up there eventually, if you’re brave enough to seek it out. Stay away from there for now though."

**"Can you tell us anything else about the blue crystals**
> Ah, the Lunashards, eh? Those crystals ain't just any old rocks, lemme tell ya. They were the heart of our power, pulsin' with raw, pure magic. Had to be mighty careful with them though or they'd bite ya. Maybe I'll tell you why we called them Lunashards someday, but today is not that day. 

**"What’s the best way to prepare for our journey?"**
> "Stay sharp, stick together, and always have a plan. Don’t be afraid to ask for help from the folks you along the way. They might surprise ya."

 **When he's done talking.**...
> Alright, folks, that's enough chit-chat for now. I’m gonna take a little break, you know, recharge my essence or whatever. Don't go gettin' into too much trouble without me. I’ll be around when you need me again, but for now, I’m goin’ back to... well, not exactly sleep, but you get the idea.

#### Day 1, Evening

##### RP Encounter: The Mysterious Traveler

> As you are resting at a campfire by the road, night has fallen, and the forest around them is quiet except for the occasional rustle of leaves. 
> 
> As the flames crackle, a cloaked figure emerges from the darkness, the hood pulled low over his face. He approaches the campfire cautiously, his hands risen. 

**Mysterious Traveler**: 
"Good evening, travelers. Might I share your fire for a moment? The night is cold, and the road long."

. . . 

**Mysterious Traveler**: 
"I couldn't help but overhear your tales of adventure. Have you, by any chance, come across... peculiar crystals in your journeys? Ones that seem to pulse with a strange, almost magical light?"

. . . 


**Mysterious Traveler**: 
"Ah, perhaps I am mistaken. These are rare, indeed. Some isles know them as Lunashards."


**Mysterious Traveler**: 
*Realizing his mistake, the traveler quickly composes himself.* 
"Never mind me, just the ramblings of an old man. If you do happen upon any, remember, they can be quite valuable... to the right people."

*He stands, adjusting his cloak.*

**Mysterious Traveler**: 
"Thank you for the warmth of your fire. Safe travels, friends."

*With that, he vanishes into the night, leaving the adventurers with more questions than answers.*

##### What does he look like? 
**Perception or Insight Checks**

###### DC 10 Check - Slight Recognition

As you observe the traveler, you notice his cloak's subtle aquatic motifs and ancient runes. There's something oddly familiar about the small, glowing blue crystals embedded in his staff, though you can't quite place their significance. His voice carries the calm steadiness of the sea.

###### DC 15 Check - More Details

The adventurer appears to be a race of amphibious humanoids. He has a lean, sinewy build, standing at about six feet tall. 

You realize that the traveler's cloak and staff are adorned with intricate carvings and runes that seem to be of ancient, aquatic origin. The blue crystals in his staff catch your eye, as they resemble descriptions of rare magical artifacts from ancient times. His voice, with its wave-like cadence, suggests a deep connection to the sea.


###### DC 25 Check (or nat20) - Most Details
The adventurer appears to be a race of amphibious humanoids. He is *not* a Triton. He has a lean, sinewy build, standing at about six feet tall. His skin has a slight blue-green hue, reminiscent of ocean depths, and is textured like sharkskin. His eyes are deep and dark, reflecting a wealth of untold stories and a hint of mystery. 

He wears a long, weathered cloak that seems to blend seamlessly with his surroundings, giving him an almost ethereal presence. The cloak is adorned with subtle aquatic motifs and ancient runes, hinting at his deep connection to the sea and his knowledge of ancient lore. Underneath, he dons practical, yet well-worn leather armor, designed for both protection and mobility.

His movements are fluid and graceful, betraying his aquatic heritage. When he speaks, his voice carries the cadence of the waves, calm and steady, but with an undertone of deep currents and hidden depths. The traveler carries a staff carved from driftwood, with intricate carvings and embedded with small, glowing blue crystals, similar to Lunashards. His demeanor is calm and composed, but there is an air of urgency and purpose in his eyes.

###### Failed Check

You notice that the traveler seems out of place, his attire and demeanor different from the usual travelers you encounter. However, nothing specific stands out about him, and you are left with a sense of curiosity but no concrete details.

- Elara will tell them of the cursed Castle Thorne to the west.

> “There is a place not far from Eboncrest, along the coast, that has fallen into shadow and danger—**Castle Thorne**. Once a proud symbol of nobility, the castle has been overtaken by a terrible curse. Dark roses now engulf its walls, and its former guardians have turned into monstrous versions of themselves: Rose Guard, Knights of the Flowers, and Hedge Mages.”

> “The curse has begun to spread outward like weeds, overtaking the small village outside the castle. I don’t know why this has happened, but the curse now threatens to engulf the surrounding lands. Will you investigate and destroy the cause of this curse?”

### Choosing Your Next Steps...

From here the players could decide to ... 
- Pick up one of the quests and begin that chain.
- They could look for more leads to Vyra, they currently have no leads. A quest should give them some.
- Look for the seedy underbelly of Eboncrest, although they have no reason to believe there is one yet. A quest should give them some. 

Either way, this is likely all the time we have for Session 4. Session 5 will begin with wherever they decide to go.
