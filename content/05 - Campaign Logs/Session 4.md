### Narrative Recap


> The adventurers ventured into the ancient ruins, encountering Ren, a turtle-like being, and Sylvain, an elf who had been trapped in the ruins trying to solve a riddle. Ren introduced himself, confused and hesitant about his new form. Sylvain, having spent considerable time deciphering the ruins' secrets, welcomed the newcomers and shared his knowledge. Eldric and Thistle, however, were initially skeptical of Ren and tested his resilience in a playful scuffle. Posidonius approached the ethereal figures hovering above the pool to gather clues for the riddle.
> 
> The group faced the ghosts' riddles, each representing an elemental force. Despite some incorrect guesses, Sylvain's quick thinking led him to shout all the elemental names at once. This action caused the ghosts to speak over each other, revealing the answers. The ghosts acknowledged the adventurers' wisdom and granted them the key to proceed. With this new information, the group felt a surge of accomplishment and unity, strengthening their resolve to face the dangers ahead.
> 
> The adventurers entered the Guardian's Hall, a dimly lit room guarded by two massive reanimated guardians. Using their wits, they devised a plan to turn the guardians against each other by throwing rocks between them, causing confusion and rage. The Guardians, mistaking the rocks for intruders, attacked in the direction of the rock... hitting and doing damage to their counterpart. The party watched as the guardians destroyed each other, allowing them to proceed without a harmful direct confrontation.
> 
> Descending into the final chamber, the adventurers were confronted by the Mistress of Shadows, Vyrra. Her imposing presence and chilling monologue revealed her plans to control the Isle and prevent another cataclysm. Sylvain, realizing the imminent threat, sprinted back to North Lodge to seek help. He navigated through the Goblin Cave, pleading with Grubnar for aid. The urgency in his voice and the dire situation convinced the goblin leader to assist in the defense of North Lodge.
> 
> Meanwhile, the rest of the party worked to overcharge the arcane runes on the ground. Their efforts created an unstable, temporary portal back to North Lodge. As they stepped through, the portal collapsed, causing the ruins to implode. The heroes narrowly escaped, emerging in North Lodge to the sound of alarms and hurried preparations. The townspeople, seeing the urgency in the adventurers' eyes, rallied to help defend their home from the impending attack.
> 
> The adventurers spread throughout North Lodge, urging the villagers to arm themselves and prepare for battle. They explained the threat of the Changelings and Barghests, convincing even the skeptical to take action. Darius and Miri fortified the walls, setting up defensive positions. Miri, with a hint of mischief, revealed a flamethrower turret she had been working on with Gareth, promising it would "heat things up." Gareth joined forces with Azzika, Garos, and Syrain at a different outpost, ready to fend off the attackers.
> 
> As night fell, the changeling forces, led by Barghests, began their assault on North Lodge. The villagers, now armed and prepared, fought valiantly alongside the adventurers. Darius demonstrated his combat prowess, leading the trainees by example. The flamethrower turret, manned by Miri, proved to be a game-changer, scorching the attacking forces. Garos, now fully embracing his new form and abilities, fought fiercely, protecting his newfound home. The battle was intense, but the combined efforts of the townspeople and adventurers led to a hard-fought victory, ensuring the safety of North Lodge and thwarting the Mistress's plans... at least for now.

### Choosing Your Next Steps...

From here the players could decide to ... 
- Pick up one of the quests and begin that chain.
- They could look for more leads to Vyra, they currently have no leads. A quest should give them some.
- Look for the seedy underbelly of Eboncrest, although they have no reason to believe there is one yet. A quest should give them some. 

Either way, this is likely all the time we have for Session 4. Session 5 will begin with wherever they decide to go.
