## Recap

> Your party has just freed **Mazerisha** from her curse and **Theadora** from her death sentence... in doing so, you damned an entire island... by literally burning their ships and burning the town to the ground as you sailed away. **Elirath**, the tiefling guardswoman, was likely among the dead. **Samantha** and **Sarah**, whom you left in Mazerisha's tomb, have an unknown fate.
> 
> **Snappy** had a run-in with a god. He is now a Goliath Barbarian Zealot after a transformation in a hidden mountain shrine to the goddess **Sindri**. Little is known about why this happened, but it seems Sindri took a particular liking to Snappy.
> 
> **Posidonius** had a spark of inspiration on Glenthorp Island, merging his arcane talents with his growing knowledge of engineering.
> 
> **Sylvain** grows more despondent as his worldview crumbles, struggling with the changes around him.
> 
> **Garos**, now an agile fighter with a matchstick maul, has received a letter from **Erisol Shyx**. 
> 
> This leads the party to **Undertow**, a coastal town on the island of **Saru**.

## Act 1: The Arrival in Undertow



#### Undertow

- **Atmosphere:** The town is lively with an undercurrent of caution. People are friendly but reserved. There are few non-elves in town, and the party stands out, though this is counterbalanced by the many other travelers who have come for the same event.
- **Notable Features:** The bustling harbor is lined with various vendors offering local seafood, crafts, and trinkets. Among the crowd, you notice an unusual air of anticipation, as if something significant is about to happen.

- **Skill Check Opportunities**:
  - **Insight (DC 13)**: The party senses an air of caution from the locals, but nothing immediately threatening.
  - **Perception (DC 14)**: The party notices other treasure hunters and adventurers gathering supplies and conversing about maps, treasure hunts, and potential rewards.

#### Teppa Tapp Encounter

> The sun is setting as you traverse the long boardwalk on the seafront of Undertow. The smell of the sea air hits your face as you see several fishing boats starting to bring in their hauls. As you walk along, you can hear the calls of several market stalls as they hawk fresh scallops, smoked haddock, and other local delicacies.
> 
> As you pass by a tavern, you see a pair of young, smiling half-elves walk away from an elven woman. As you look over, she turns to match your gaze, then grasps her satchel and begins to approach. She bows slightly with one hand on her top hat perched between her swept-back ears and introduces herself.
>
> **"Teppa Tapp at your service! You seem like the kind of people who are looking for adventure!"**



- **Teppa's Sales Pitch**: 
  > "I have something very special for you—an opportunity you won't find elsewhere! A treasure map that leads to riches beyond imagination, hidden away just off the coast of the islands. Only 100 gold pieces for a chance at untold fortune! "
  
  **Persuasion Check**: 
  - **DC 15**: "Well, since you seem like the right group for this, I could lower it to 90 gold pieces. Just for you." For every 2 points above 15, the price drops by an additional 10% (up to a 50% discount).
  - **Fail**: No, I think 100gp is a steal for the tressure this map could bring you. 
  
  **Insight Check**:
  - **DC 12**: "This seems like a rehearsed pitch... she's definitely done this before, selling the same map to many adventurers."
  - **Fail**: Seems like a great deal. 

> You know what... I like you guys. I'll reach out to my friend Braw and see if she can be your guide in these turbulent waters. I'm sure she won't mind! 


##### Questions from the Players:
- **How much is the map?**
  > "A hundred gold pieces—guaranteed treasure worth at least six times that! If you find less, we refund you."

- **How many maps have you sold?**
  > "Five since this morning. I expect to sell ten more by nightfall. But don't worry, everyone gets a fair start. The map doesn't reveal the exact location until dawn, and only if you're in Undertow harbor."


- **Insight Check (DC 20):**
  - **Pass**: The party can tell she's selling multiple copies of the map. She's probably more interested in luring people to their doom than in the treasure itself.
  - **Fail**: Everything seems on the up and up. 




### An Entire Off-Shoot I guess

You guys wondered off into the village to sell stuff. 
- Met a guy named johnny. 
- Theadora and Mazerisha seem trustworthy

### The Bountiful Booty Tavern

#### Setting the Scene:

The **Bountiful Booty Tavern** is a bustling, pirate-themed tavern filled with rough seafarers, treasure hunters, and adventurers from all walks of life. The air is thick with the smell of ale and roasted fish, while the sound of clinking mugs and animated conversation fills the room.

> As you enter the **Bountiful Booty**, the tavern is alive with the sound of shanties and loud conversation. The floorboards creak under your feet, and the walls are adorned with decorative ship wheels, broken oars, and a few rusted cutlasses that have seen better days. Several groups of adventurers are scattered across the room, each discussing their upcoming expeditions. At the center of it all sits a crew of elves, their quiet yet confident demeanor standing out amidst the raucous crowd.

---

#### The Elven Adventuring Crew: The Wave Dancers

**Group Name:** The Wave Dancers  
**Leader:** **Corden Rastago**, a stoic elven sea captain  
**Crew Members:**
- **Lyria Daewen**, a charming elven sorceress  
- **Thalindor Korvos**, a battle-hardened elven fighter  
- **Eryndor Baelith**, a sharp-eyed elven ranger  

The **Wave Dancers** are an elite group of elven treasure hunters who have been participating in treasure hunts across the **Sea of Vodari** for years. They are well known for their disciplined teamwork, and their reputation often precedes them in coastal cities like Undertow.

---

##### Detailed Descriptions and Personalities

###### **Corden Rastago** – *Elven Captain (Lawful Neutral)*

- **Appearance**: Tall and lean with silver hair tied back in a single braid, piercing green eyes, and a stoic expression. Corden wears a weathered captain's coat with intricate elven embroidery.
- **Personality**: Reserved, calculating, and highly disciplined. Corden always speaks with calm authority, rarely showing emotion in public.
- **Motivation**: Corden's goal is to secure a legacy for his family, whose naval lineage stretches back centuries. He sees treasure hunting as a way to elevate his family's status and fortune, especially now that the elven kingdoms' influence has diminished in some areas of the Sea of Vodari.
- **Dialogue Options**:
  - "The sea is a fickle master. Only those who plan every step survive her whims."
  - "Our map shows the same island as yours, but make no mistake—we'll be there first."
  - **Persuasion (DC 15)**: If the party appeals to his sense of honor and competition, Corden may respect their resolve and offer to help them... for a price.

---

###### **Lyria Daewen** – *Elven Sorceress (Chaotic Neutral)*

- **Appearance**: Lyria is strikingly beautiful, with platinum blonde hair that flows loosely over her shoulders and violet eyes that shimmer faintly with arcane energy. She wears elegant elven robes interwoven with magical runes.
- **Personality**: Lyria is playful, flirtatious, and mischievous. She loves the thrill of the hunt but often treats danger as a game. She has a tendency to be overconfident, bordering on reckless.
- **Motivation**: Lyria's fascination with ancient magic and powerful artifacts drives her to join the Wave Dancers. She's particularly interested in finding relics from the ancient merfolk empire rumored to exist in the area.
- **Dialogue Options**:
  - "Oh, don't look so serious, darling. This is *fun*! You might even live long enough to enjoy it."
  - "Treasure's nice and all, but what I'm really after is the magic left behind... You wouldn't believe what the merfolk knew."
  - **Insight (DC 12)**: It's clear Lyria enjoys toying with people, but her fascination with the magical relics of the ancient world is genuine. She could be an asset if the party focuses on lore or knowledge of the seas.

---

###### **Thalindor Korvos** – *Elven Fighter (Lawful Neutral)*

- **Appearance**: Thalindor is powerfully built, with dark brown hair tied in a topknot and a long scar running down his left cheek. He wears intricately designed elven plate armor with a large longsword strapped to his back.
- **Personality**: Thalindor is serious and quiet, preferring action to words. He’s fiercely loyal to Corden and serves as the crew’s enforcer and protector. Though he has little patience for conversation, he respects strength and courage in others.
- **Motivation**: Thalindor has sworn an oath of loyalty to Corden and views protecting him as his life's mission. He’s also driven by a personal vendetta against a pirate lord who once wronged him, and he's always on the lookout for information about their whereabouts.
- **Dialogue Options**:
  - "Talk less, fight more. We'll see who's still standing by the time we reach the wreck."
  - **Intimidation (DC 14)**: If the party attempts to threaten or challenge the Wave Dancers, Thalindor will step forward, hand on his sword, and stare them down.
  - **Athletics (DC 15)**: A character who engages Thalindor in a physical challenge (arm wrestling, sparring, etc.) may earn his respect, potentially leading to an alliance of convenience.

---

###### **Eryndor Baelith** – *Elven Ranger (Neutral Good)*

- **Appearance**: Eryndor is a lithe, dark-haired elf with keen eyes and a quick smile. He wears leather armor and carries a finely crafted longbow. His demeanor is relaxed, though his eyes are always alert.
- **Personality**: Friendly and approachable, Eryndor is the most diplomatic of the crew. He has a natural charisma and often acts as the peacemaker, balancing out the more intense personalities of Corden and Thalindor. He’s perceptive and enjoys striking up conversations with strangers to learn more about them.
- **Motivation**: Eryndor joined the Wave Dancers for the thrill of adventure and to see the world. Unlike his companions, he’s less concerned with wealth or power and more interested in learning about the people and places he encounters.
- **Dialogue Options**:
  - "I can tell you're new to these waters. Let me give you some advice: don't trust anyone out here, especially not the sea."
  - "I hear the Shelled Ones have taken up residence in the area. Nasty business, those crab-folk."
  - **Perception (DC 14)**: If asked, Eryndor can provide useful information about the dangers in the area. He’s heard rumors of werecrabs, disappearing treasure hunters, and ancient merfolk ruins hidden beneath the waves.

---

##### **Interaction Possibilities:**

- **Potential Rivals**: The **Wave Dancers** are well-established adventurers and may see the party as competition. If the party boasts or brags about their own abilities, Corden will likely offer a thinly veiled challenge, hinting that they’ll beat the party to the treasure.
  
  - **Persuasion (DC 14)**: If the party tries to make a friendly wager with Corden about who will reach the treasure first, he’ll agree, offering 50 gold coins to the winning crew.
  - **Intimidation (DC 16)**: Attempting to intimidate or threaten the Wave Dancers will result in Thalindor stepping forward, making it clear they won’t back down from a fight.

- **Potential Allies**: If the party is respectful or if they appeal to Lyria’s curiosity or Eryndor’s sense of adventure, they may be able to form a temporary alliance.

  - **Insight (DC 12)**: Eryndor seems the most likely to form a positive connection with the party. If approached diplomatically, he may suggest that they could pool their resources to explore the ruins together, splitting any artifacts or treasure they find.
  - **Persuasion (DC 15)**: Lyria, fascinated by the merfolk’s magical knowledge, might agree to share any lore or artifacts related to magic, leaving the rest of the treasure to the party.

---

###### **Rumors the Elves Know:**

- **The Shelled Ones**: Eryndor and Lyria have heard rumors of a tribe of lycanthropic werecrabs that are kidnapping adventurers and treasure hunters in the area. They mention that treasure hunts like this one often end with people disappearing under mysterious circumstances.
    
    - **Eryndor**: "There's something out there, hiding beneath the waves. The Shelled Ones, they call them. People who can turn into crabs, and not the friendly kind. Keep your guard up."
      
- **The Merfolk Ruins**: Lyria is particularly excited about the possibility of finding an ancient merfolk hermitage beneath the waters. She mentions that she’s heard whispers of a powerful relic hidden there, but she isn’t sure what it is.
    
    - **Lyria**: "Oh, the things we might find out there... the merfolk were masters of magic. There’s talk of a relic, something to do with controlling the ocean itself. I’m dying to see it for myself."
      
- **Rival Crews**: Corden mentions that other crews are likely setting sail as well, each with their own motivations and ambitions. He warns the party that not everyone plays fair out on the open sea.
    
    - **Corden**: "We won’t be the only ones out there. Watch your backs—there are some who’d rather stab you in the dark than fight you in the open."

### Braw Abergel

#### **Setting the Scene:**

After the party secures the treasure map from **Teppa Tapp**, they are directed to meet with **Braw Abergel**, who will be their guide for the treasure hunt. Even though the party has their own ship, the **Boatussy**, Braw is still assigned to act as their navigator and local expert, familiar with the waters and the hidden dangers of the Sea of Vodari.

---

> As you walk along the docks, the smell of brine and the sound of gulls fill the air. The waves gently lap against the hull of your ship, the **Boatussy**, which sits tied securely at the quay. You spot a half-elven woman with broad shoulders and fiery red hair braided into a long ponytail, casually perched on a barrel by the water's edge. Her weather-beaten leather jacket and salt-stained boots mark her as a seasoned sailor. She’s flipping through a small, dog-eared book, occasionally glancing up at the horizon.
>
> As you approach, she looks up, offering a wide grin, her teeth flashing. She swings her legs off the barrel and stands, eyeing your ship before speaking in a rich, lilting voice.
>
> **"Well, well, look at this beauty. You must be the ones Teppa Tapp told me about. Lucky you—I’m Braw Abergel, and I’ll be your guide for this little treasure hunt. Nice ship you’ve got there. Mind if I tag along?"**

---

#### **Braw Abergel’s Personality and Role**

- **Personality**: Braw is no-nonsense when it comes to sailing, but she has a light-hearted and friendly demeanor. She’s quick to joke and laugh, but there's an edge of seriousness when it comes to the dangers of the sea. She enjoys the camaraderie of working with adventurers and doesn’t mind a bit of mischief or banter along the way.
  
- **Motivation**: Braw is hired by Teppa Tapp’s "company" to act as a guide for treasure hunters. While she doesn’t know the full extent of the werecrab plot, she’s aware that the waters around the treasure site are treacherous. She views this job as a way to make a decent living while helping others avoid the pitfalls of inexperience on the open sea.

---

#### **Dialogue Options and Interaction**

#### **Initial Greeting**:

Braw sizes up your group with a twinkle of amusement in her eyes, clearly intrigued by your ship and confident attitude. She introduces herself more formally.

- **Braw Abergel**: 
  > "I’ve been told you lot have a knack for adventure, and judging by that ship, I’d say Teppa’s right. But even the best ship needs a good hand to guide her, especially in these waters. I know the routes, the currents, and the tricks to avoid the reefs. What do you say—let’s get this show on the road, eh?"

**Possible Player Reactions**:
1. **Accepting Her Guidance**:
    - If the party is amenable to having Braw as their guide:
    - **Braw**: 
      > "Good choice. I’ve sailed these waters more times than I care to count. Don’t worry—stick with me, and we’ll find this wreck of yours in no time. Just don’t mind me giving a few pointers along the way. It’s for your own good, promise."

2. **Questioning Her Expertise**:
   - If the party is skeptical or questions her need as a guide:
   - **Braw** (laughing): 
     > "I get it, you’ve got a fine ship, and I can see you’re more than capable. But trust me, these waters have a way of playing tricks on even the best sailors. There’s a reason Teppa pays me, after all. Let’s just say, not every map points to treasure without a few detours first."
  
   - **Insight Check (DC 12)**: The party can tell that Braw isn’t hiding anything. She genuinely believes that her experience is valuable, though she’s aware of the dangers more than she lets on.

3. **Challenging Her to Prove Herself**:
   - If the party wants to test Braw’s skill or challenge her knowledge:
   - **Braw** (grinning): 
     > "A challenge, eh? You’ve got guts, I’ll give you that. Tell you what—first one to navigate through the shallows near Storm’s Breath Rock without scraping the hull gets a round of drinks on me. That is, if you think you can keep up." 

   - **Survival (Water Navigation) Contest (DC 15)**: If the party accepts, Braw can challenge them to a friendly navigation race around a dangerous reef (Storm’s Breath Rock). If they succeed, she’ll respect their skill and offer a round of drinks at the tavern when they return. If they fail, she’ll tease them about it but be impressed with their effort.

---

#### **Braw’s Advice and Warnings**:

As the party prepares to set sail, Braw gives them some tips about navigating the Sea of Vodari, particularly around the area where the wreck of the **Rampant Pegasus** is located.

- **Braw**: 
  > "Listen up—these waters can be tricky, especially with all the reefs and hidden shallows. There’s more than just treasure hunters out here too. I’ve seen ships disappear in calm seas, never to be heard from again. And don’t even get me started on the Shelled Ones. Ever heard of ‘em?"

**Insight or Arcana Check (DC 13)**: If the party presses for more details, they can discern that Braw knows of the **Shelled Ones**, the lycanthropic werecrab tribe, but doesn’t know the full extent of their power or involvement in the treasure hunts.

---

#### **Banter and Personality Quirks**:

During the journey, Braw keeps things light with occasional banter, but she takes her role seriously, often checking the waters and adjusting course when necessary.

- **Braw** (teasing): 
  > "Hope you’ve got your sea legs! These waters can turn choppy faster than a gnome with a new invention."
  
- **Perception Check (DC 12)**: If the players observe her carefully, they’ll notice that Braw’s casual demeanor hides a sharp eye for danger. She’s constantly scanning the horizon and the waves, and her hands never stray too far from the wheel or her map.
  
- **Braw’s Motto**:
  > "A good ship and a good crew are all well and fine, but knowing when to change course? That’s what keeps you afloat."




## Act 2: The Competition Begins

---

#### **The Map Reveals the Location at Dawn**

As dawn breaks, the map glows with magical energy, revealing the location of the **Rampant Pegasus** wreck in **Typhoon Bay**, a perilous area surrounded by jagged rocks and known for its dangerous currents.

> The first light of dawn touches the horizon, and as it does, the map in your hands flickers and shifts, showing a small, jagged island to the northwest. The name **“Rampant Pegasus”** appears, along with an image of a shipwreck, half-buried beneath the waves. A sense of anticipation hangs in the air—this is what you’ve been waiting for.

---

#### **Skill Challenges for Navigation**

Before the players reach the wreck, they must navigate the dangerous waters leading to **Typhoon Bay**. This part of the Sea of Vodari is notorious for sharp reefs, strong currents, and sudden fog banks.

- **Survival (DC 13)**: The party can navigate safely through the bay with Braw’s assistance. A failure means they scrape against a reef, causing minor hull damage to the **Boatussy**. Players must then perform repairs or risk further damage.
  
- **Nature (DC 12)**: Recognizing signs of an incoming storm or turbulent waters can help the party avoid dangerous weather. With a success, they adjust their sails and rigging to maintain control. Failure means they are caught in rough seas, slowing their progress and disorienting them.

- **Perception (DC 14)**: The party notices something strange beneath the water—large shadows moving just beneath the surface, hinting at something alive in the depths. Failure to spot this might result in a surprise attack later from the sea creatures or werecrabs.

---

#### **The Krakentooth Appears**

As the party approaches the wreck’s location, the **Krakentooth**—a fearsome brigantine with tattered sails and a kraken-like figurehead—appears from behind the rocky island, cutting off the **Boatussy**'s approach. The ship belongs to a crew of rival treasure hunters who are intent on claiming the wreck for themselves.

> Out of the morning mist, a dark shape emerges from behind the jagged rocks. The **Krakentooth** sails in silence, its black sails catching the early light. The crew stands ready, weapons drawn, as the ship pulls alongside the **Boatussy**. Captain Yoi stands at the bow, grinning. "Looks like we’re not the only ones after the treasure. Let’s see if you’ve got the guts to take it."

---

### **The Krakentooth Combat**

The **Krakentooth** immediately engages the party in combat. 



#### **Phase 1: The Grappling Hooks**

The **Krakentooth** crew first tries to close the gap between ships using grappling hooks and ropes, intending to board the **Boatussy** and engage in hand-to-hand combat. 

- **Skill Challenge**:
  - **Strength (Athletics) (DC 12)**: Players can attempt to cut the grappling hooks or push off boarding enemies before they gain a foothold. Each success reduces the number of boarders that make it across to their ship.
  - **Dexterity (Acrobatics) (DC 13)**: Alternatively, players can leap onto the **Krakentooth** themselves, turning the tables and attacking the enemy on their own ship. Successful players will face off with the **Krakentooth** crew directly.

---

#### **Phase 2: Boarders Attack**

Once the boarding action begins, the **Krakentooth** crew—led by **Captain Yoi "Flathorn"** and **First Mate Zeddaluf**—engages in fierce combat. The enemy crew consists of tough melee fighters and one powerful spellcaster.

##### **Captain Yoi "Flathorn"** (*Satyr Warrior*):
- **Appearance**: A tall, lithe satyr with curling horns and a wicked grin. She wields a magical cutlass and moves with unnerving speed.
- **Combat Tactics**: Captain Yoi uses her agility and charm to taunt and manipulate her foes. Her cutlass, **Anchorhook**, allows her to pull enemies closer or disarm them.
  - **Taunt (Bonus Action)**: Yoi can target a player within 30 feet and force them to make a **Wisdom Save (DC 14)** or be taunted, causing them to focus on her for the next turn.
  - **Anchorhook (Attack)**: Yoi’s cutlass can pull a target within 20 feet toward her. The target must make a **Strength Save (DC 15)** to resist. If pulled, the target is grappled.

**Dialogue**:  
- "Come on, is that the best you’ve got? I thought this was supposed to be a *challenge*!"
- "This treasure’s mine, but I don’t mind sharing... your corpse with the sea."

##### **First Mate Zeddaluf** (*Human Mage*):
- **Appearance**: A gaunt, hooded figure with glowing, arcane tattoos. He stays back from the melee, casting spells to control the battlefield.
- **Combat Tactics**: Zeddaluf specializes in disabling the party with spells like **Hold Person** and **Web**, using **Magic Missile** to target vulnerable characters.
  - **Hold Person**: Zeddaluf targets the party’s fighter or tank, trying to immobilize them while the crew swarms them.
  - **Magic Missile**: He focuses on spellcasters or healers to whittle down their health and break concentration.

**Dialogue**:  
- "Let’s see how you handle real power, mortals."
- "You’ve walked right into your own demise. Perfect."

##### **Krakentooth Crew (4 Pirates)**:
- **Tactics**: The crew focuses on trying to isolate and overwhelm individual party members, working in pairs to flank and grapple. They attempt to push weaker characters toward the edge of the ship to throw them overboard.

---

#### **Phase 3: Environmental Challenges and Chaos**

As the fight rages on, the environment around the ships becomes a hazard in itself. Use these elements to make the battle more dynamic and unpredictable.

##### **Sudden Storm (Round 3 or 4)**:
A fierce storm begins to brew, churning the water and making movement on deck treacherous.

- **Dexterity Saving Throw (DC 13)**: Each player must make a saving throw at the beginning of their turn to stay on their feet. On a failure, they are knocked prone.
  
##### **High Waves**:
Every two rounds, a particularly large wave crashes against the side of the ship, threatening to throw characters overboard.

- **Strength Saving Throw (DC 14)**: Players near the edge of the ship must make a save or be pushed overboard.

**If Overboard**:  
- Characters who fall into the water will have to make **Athletics (DC 12)** checks to stay afloat, and **Strength (DC 14)** checks to grab a line and pull themselves back up. Meanwhile, the chaotic battle continues above them.

---

#### **Phase 4: The Merfolk Intervention**

Just when it seems the battle is reaching its peak, a new faction enters the fray: the **Merfolk Brinesword Warriors**. These merfolk leap from the water, armed with tridents and spells, attacking both ships in a desperate bid to stop the treasure hunt.

> The sea roils, and from beneath the water, sleek shapes rise. **Merfolk**, armed with tridents and shimmering armor, burst from the waves, leaping onto both ships with grim determination. "This place is forbidden! Turn back, or face the wrath of the sea!"

- **Tactics**: The merfolk focus on controlling the battlefield, attempting to disarm both sides with non-lethal force. They use **Fog Cloud** and **Gust of Wind** to obscure vision and push players around the ship.

##### **Merfolk Brinesword Warriors** (*2 Warriors*):

- **Appearance**: Sleek and powerful, their scales shimmer in the early light. They carry enchanted tridents, which allow them to control water and summon minor whirlpools.
- **Combat Tactics**: The merfolk target both the players and the **Krakentooth** crew indiscriminately. They attempt to drive both sides back into the water, using their natural environment to their advantage.
  - **Trident of Water Control**: The merfolk can create small whirlpools, forcing creatures within 10 feet of the center to make a **Strength Saving Throw (DC 13)** or be pulled 5 feet toward the center.

##### **Merfolk Stormcaller** (*1 Caster*):

- **Appearance**: A regal figure with flowing seaweed robes, standing in the water and commanding the elements.
- **Combat Tactics**: The **Stormcaller** stays in the water, casting spells like **Fog Cloud** to disrupt the battlefield and **Call Lightning** to strike both ships.
  - **Call Lightning**: The **Stormcaller** targets a single player or **Krakentooth** crew member. The character must make a **Dexterity Saving Throw (DC 14)** or take 3d10 lightning damage.

---

#### **Phase 5: Resolving the Battle

The battle can end in several ways, depending on the actions of the players.

- **Victory Over the Krakentooth**: If the players defeat Captain Yoi and her crew, the **Krakentooth** will retreat or be left adrift, leaving the **Boatussy** victorious. The players can then loot the enemy ship for supplies, maps, or magical items (such as Yoi’s **Anchorhook** or Zeddaluf’s spellbook).
  
- **Victory for the Merfolk**: If the party convinces the **merfolk** to withdraw or broker a truce (successful **Persuasion (DC 15)**), the merfolk may allow the party to continue with a warning about the dangers beneath the sea.
  - **Merfolk Warning**: "Disturb the treasure at your own peril. You risk awakening ancient forces not meant to be disturbed."

- **Retreat or Defeat**: If the players are overwhelmed, they may need to retreat, losing the opportunity to loot the wreck. If they fall, they may be captured by the **Krakentooth** crew or the merfolk and ransomed back, or face further complications.

---

#### **Post-Battle: Preparing for the Dive**

After the battle concludes, the **Boatussy** can finally approach the wreck of the **Rampant Pegasus**. As the crew prepares to dive below, **Braw Abergel** will offer her final thoughts:

> "Well, that was something, wasn’t it? But we’re not done yet. The wreck’s just up ahead, and whatever’s waiting for us... well, it can’t be worse than what we just faced, right?"


### **Wrap-Up and Setting Up for the Treasure Site**

As the party nears the site of the wreck, **Braw** will steer them toward the general location, offering her final words of caution:

- **Braw** (serious): 
  > "This is it. The wreck’s just beyond that ridge, but we’ll need to be careful. It’s not just treasure hunters we need to worry about—the sea itself has a few surprises up her sleeve. I’ll stay on the lookout while you dive. Keep your wits about you, and good luck."

She’ll stay aboard the **Boatussy**, keeping the ship ready for a quick escape if necessary.


---



## **Act 3: The Dive to the Rampant Pegasus**

---

#### **The Descent**

As the party prepares to dive into the water, **Braw Abergel** ensures the ship is secured and encourages them to be cautious.

> **Braw Abergel**: "This is it. Keep your eyes open down there. If the sea’s hiding anything nastier than the Krakentooth, you’ll find it here. Don’t get lost—and if things get rough, swim back fast."

**Spell Preparations**: If your party has spellcasters, encourage them to cast **Water Breathing**, **Darkvision**, or any other helpful spells before the dive. If not, Braw might suggest using potions or equipment.

---

#### **The Wreck of the Rampant Pegasus**

Once the party dives into the ocean, the vast and silent world beneath the waves stretches out before them. As they swim closer to the coordinates marked on the map, they’ll begin to see the dark shape of the wreck below.

> The water around you is dark, murky, and cold. As you swim deeper, the silhouette of a broken ship begins to emerge from the gloom, its once-mighty masts broken and scattered across the seafloor. The **Rampant Pegasus** lies in ruins, its hull split in two, half-buried in the sand and debris of this underwater graveyard.

- **Perception Check (DC 12)**: If successful, a player notices something off to the side—small gleaming coins and bits of treasure scattered on the ocean floor, as if dragged away from the ship by something unnatural.

**Skill Challenge: Swimming Through the Wreck**  
As the party explores the wreck, they must navigate through its broken remains and avoid hazards.

- **Athletics (DC 12)**: Players must swim through narrow spaces or broken decks. Failure might result in a piece of wreckage falling or becoming stuck temporarily, costing them time and effort to free themselves.
- **Investigation (DC 14)**: Careful inspection of the ship’s broken hold reveals that something or someone recently rifled through it. Precious treasures have been disturbed, dragged across the seabed toward the nearby crevasse.

---

#### **The Crevasse and the Hidden Structure**

As the party follows the drag marks, they reach the edge of a deep ocean trench, revealing an ancient structure hidden beneath the waves.

> Following the trail of disturbed sand and debris, you come to a steep drop-off in the ocean floor, a dark crevasse carved deep into the earth. Gazing over the edge, you spot your prize—a sunken ship resting at the bottom of the crevasse, its masts long broken and its hull shattered beyond repair.
>
> But the ship isn’t the only thing down here. Carved into the side of the crevasse is the front face of an elaborate building, hewn from the rock itself. At its center, a large stone bust of an old man with flowing hair and a thick beard stares down into the valley. Surrounding the central archway are smaller alcoves, carved into the rock, filled with forgotten treasures.

#### **Notable Features of the Crevasse**:

- **The Rampant Pegasus**: The wreck sits partially buried in the sandy crevasse, but a trail of treasure leads away from it. The party can choose to explore the wreck more thoroughly or follow the trail to the ancient building.
  
- **The Building**: This structure appears to be of merfolk origin, long-abandoned and carved directly into the rock. The central bust is worn by time but still watches ominously over the crevasse. The architecture gives off an ancient and unsettling feeling.

- **The River of Sea Creatures**: To the west of the structure, a river of sea creatures—schools of fish, eels, and larger marine life—descend into a second, larger hole in the ocean floor. These creatures are being drawn by some unknown force, compelled to swim into the dark depths below.

**Arcana Check (DC 13)**: The players may sense faint traces of magical energy emanating from the second hole, as if some ancient power or creature stirs deep below the surface.

#### **Spotting the Werecrabs**

As the party approaches the structure, they’ll notice movement near the entrance. Four humanoid figures emerge from the stone archway, and it quickly becomes clear that these are no ordinary enemies.

> As you near the stairs leading up to the ancient structure, you see movement. Four humanoid figures step from the shadows of the carved archway. They are six feet tall, their weapons and armor familiar, but their bodies... twisted. Their heads and torsos are encased in thick, crab-like shells. Each has one arm that ends in a massive, razor-sharp claw, while the other ends in a humanoid hand, albeit with thick, chitinous fingers. Short, vestigial crab legs twitch from their backs as they move with unsettling precision, their eyes locking on you.

### **Combat Encounter: The Werecrab Patrol**

**Werecrabs (4 Total)**:
- **Appearance**: These creatures have the bodies of humanoid soldiers, but their flesh has twisted into hard, chitinous shells, with a large crab claw on one side. Their heads resemble crabs, with beady eyes and antennae twitching.
- **Combat Tactics**: The werecrabs fight with brutal efficiency, using their natural armor and powerful claws to overwhelm opponents in melee combat. They also use their knowledge of the terrain to their advantage, attempting to flank the party or push them into dangerous currents.

---

#### **Werecrab Stat Blocks and Abilities**:

- **Werecrab Clawcrusher**: The heavy hitter of the group, this werecrab wields a massive claw that can crush armor and shield alike.
  - **Multiattack**: The werecrab makes two attacks: one with its claw and one with its weapon.
  - **Claw (Melee Weapon Attack)**: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. **Hit**: 12 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 14).
  - **Crush Armor (Recharge 5-6)**: If the werecrab has grappled a target, it can use this action to crush the target’s armor, dealing 1d6 extra damage and reducing the target’s Armor Class by 1 until the armor is repaired.

- **Werecrab Shellshield**: This werecrab fights defensively, using its tough shell and claw to block attacks and protect its allies.
  - **Defensive Stance (Bonus Action)**: The Shellshield enters a defensive stance, giving it +2 AC until the start of its next turn.
  - **Bash (Melee Weapon Attack)**: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. **Hit**: 8 (1d10 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a **Strength Saving Throw (DC 13)** or be knocked prone.

---

#### **Dialogue During Combat**:

The werecrabs are intelligent, though they rarely speak in full sentences. Instead, they communicate through a mixture of guttural clicks and the occasional word.

- **Werecrab Leader**: *"No... disturb... treasure!"*
- **Werecrab Patrol**: *"You... not welcome...!"*

### **Tactical Considerations for the Fight**

1. **Underwater Combat**: The fight takes place underwater, which affects how movement and combat work. Characters without a swim speed suffer disadvantage on melee attacks unless they are using weapons like spears, tridents, or crossbows. Spells that require verbal components are also difficult to cast without magical assistance.
  
2. **Hazards**: The sharp rocks and jagged edges of the crevasse offer opportunities for environmental hazards. If a player or werecrab is pushed into a rock formation, they take **1d6 slashing damage** from the sharp coral.

3. **Choke Points**: The stairs leading to the ancient building create a natural choke point. The werecrabs will try to use this to their advantage, forcing the party to fight in close quarters.

### **Victory and Aftermath**

Once the party defeats the werecrabs, they can explore the area further. The trail of treasure leads up the stairs and into the building, where the true depths of the **Rampant Pegasus**’ secret await.

---

#### **Possible Loot**:

- **Merfolk Relics**: Scattered among the wreckage and inside the ancient alcoves, the party finds various ancient relics from the long-lost merfolk civilization. These relics are not only valuable but may have magical properties or hold clues to the deeper mysteries of the sea.
  
- **Werecrab Carapaces**: The werecrabs' shells are tough and can be harvested for crafting armor or magical items. These materials may be useful for trading or forging new equipment back in Undertow.

#### **Next Steps:**

This encounter marks the beginning of the party’s exploration of the **ancient merfolk hermitage**. The building carved into the rock holds more than just treasure—it may contain the key to understanding the werecrab infestation and the ancient powers that stir beneath the sea.

> As you catch your breath, the trail of treasure continues, leading up the stairs to the carved entrance of the stone structure. The bust of the old man

 watches over you, and a cold sense of foreboding fills the water. Whatever secrets lie within, they’re about to be uncovered...

This sets up the next chapter of your campaign, with deeper mysteries and challenges waiting within the ancient ruins.
