## Notes:

- Party probably chases Sidewinder. They should discover that he's a changeling implaced by Vyra. Vyra intended to use Ylgramaxillian as full power to destroy Saru. 
- Vyra image appears after defeating Sidewinder, explaining the following:
	- The lunashards are actually shards from the literal heart of Lupara, the moon god who was slaughtered by the Eldoran eons ago. This heart was a massive crystal kept at the heart of the Eldoran's capital city, Vesiliaura - or Vesi for short.
	- It is with these magical, powerful artifacts that they powered their world. 
	- However, without the moon god, the seas were cast into chaos. 
	- In their pride, they planned to seek more power to control the now chaotic oceans. Vyra attempted to stop them. 
	- Their conflict lead to the destruction of Lupara's Heart, which exploded - annihilating the Elodrai and creating Vesi's Rage - either directly or indirectly by destroying the powerful artifacts that kept the seas around their capital at bay. 
	- Vyra, who was at he heart of the city at the time, was miraculously survived the encounter - but was changed. She was twisted to what she is today. Cold. Hurt. Determined to keep the world where it belongs - far, far below the gods.
	- Vyra believes that the world, although a fraction of what it once was, has become far too advanced once more. She's made it her mission to set it back to where it belongs. 


## Percy Enters Vodari


Percival "Percy" Sullivan’s life changed in an instant. One moment, he was a 5'11" college student, half-asleep in his dorm, coasting through yet another major change. The next, he was a 2'2" halfling in a world he didn’t understand. His first twelve hours in Vodari were pure chaos. With no powers and no guidance, Percy’s survival depended on the skills he honed in his old life—critical thinking, quick reflexes, and a knack for improvisation, honed through countless hours of video games. 

Despite the odds, he managed to fend off the dangers of this strange land. What truly defined him, however, was a moment of compassion. He came across a wounded traveler and, without hesitation, helped them to safety, using every scrap of ingenuity he had. What Percy didn’t know was that this stranger was no ordinary wanderer—it was Tero, the god of light, love, and healing, in disguise.  

Impressed, Tero revealed himself eight hours ago. In a radiant flash, the god stood before Percy and began a long conversation. They spoke of Percy’s world, of Vodari, and of the god’s hidden grief. Through these hours, a bond formed—not of master and servant, but of equals in spirit. Tero saw in Percy a soul worth empowering, someone capable of holding great responsibility with the humility and kindness required of his mission.  

In an awe-inspiring moment, Tero transformed Percy. The small halfling body shimmered, becoming an Aasimar, though still halfling in stature. The god granted him the powers of a cleric, a divine champion bound by purpose. With this power came a sacred mission: to restore Tero’s lost sister, Lunara, the goddess of the moon.  

Before departing, Tero gave Percy one last piece of guidance. “There is a group, each driven by fate. Seek them near the portal. Together, your paths will intertwine, and the light of the moon may yet shine once more.”  

**Tero**: “Before you go, there is a group, each driven by fate. Seek them near the portal. Together, your paths will intertwine, and the light of the moon may yet shine once more. You got this.”

**Percy**: You seem far more powerful and I. If you can't resurrect your sister, how could I?

**Tero**: *His golden eyes soften, and he places a gentle hand on your shoulder.*  

"Power alone is not enough, Percy. My connection to Lunara was severed long ago, and with it, my ability to bring her back. It’s like trying to light a fire when you’ve lost the spark."  

*He pauses, his expression thoughtful.*  

"But you… you are different. You are of both worlds, unbound by the ancient rifts that keep us apart. Your perspective, your compassion, and your resilience are the keys. You can carry the spark where I cannot, rekindle the bond that was lost."  

*He kneels slightly, meeting your eyes at your level.*  

"Sometimes, it takes someone outside the divine to see the truth we gods overlook. That’s why it must be you."


**Percy**:  I had a feeling this wasn't my world, were you the one who brought me here?

**Tero**: *His hand retreats, and a faint, almost wistful smile crosses his face.*  

"No, Percy, it wasn’t me. Your arrival here was not of my design."  

*His gaze drifts upward, as if searching the heavens for answers.*  

"Something—or someone—brought you to Vodari for a reason beyond even my sight. I only recognized your potential once you were here. That’s why I reached out. But whoever pulled you from your world… their purpose remains hidden, even from me."  

*His eyes meet yours again, steady and reassuring.*  

"What I do know is that your presence here is no accident. You were meant for something greater, and together, we’ll uncover what that is."


**Percy**: the group of travelers I am waiting for, are they followers of yours as well? are they already on the quest to save lupara?

**Tero**: *He nods slowly, a glimmer of pride mixed with sadness in his eyes.*  

"They do not yet realize it, but they walk the path toward Lunara’s salvation. Each of them has their own reasons, their own struggles, but fate has drawn them together. They are gathering Lunashards—fragments of my sister’s heart, scattered when she fell. Without those shards, her resurrection is impossible."  

*His tone grows heavier, more serious.*  

"But their journey is fraught with obstacles, chief among them Vyra. She was once a beacon of hope, a protector of this world. Now, she seeks to delay its progress, to stop the shards from being united. Her methods are harsh, even cruel, but her motives… they stem from fear. She believes that resurrecting Lunara could bring about another catastrophe."  

*Tero’s voice softens, almost mournful.*  

"Her heart, though misguided, is still rooted in a desire to protect. She fears what she cannot control. But fear has blinded her to the truth—that Vodari cannot thrive without balance. Without Lunara’s light, the world will wither."  

*He looks at you with resolve.*  

"You will help them see the greater purpose, Percy. Together, you’ll gather the shards, confront Vyra, and bring back the light of the moon. But be ready—convincing Vyra will be no simple task."


**Percy**:  Thank you, Tero. You can count on me. If you think of anything else or if there are  other gods that need reviving or worlds that need saving just let me know. I got this. 

**Tero**: *He places a hand over his chest and bows his head slightly, his fiery aura dimming to a warm glow.*  

"Thank you, Percy. Your resolve does you credit, and I will not forget it. You carry more than divine power—you carry hope."  

*He straightens, a faint smile on his lips.*  

"I will call upon you if the need arises, and I have no doubt you will rise to meet it. But for now, focus on Lunara. Her light will guide Vodari, and perhaps, in time, reveal more of your own path."  

*His form begins to shimmer and fade, his voice lingering in the air.*  

"Go with my blessing, my friend. The flames of destiny burn brightly within you."

## Sidewinder's Final Confrontation

_The party emerges from the swirling portal, stepping into a dense, vibrant forest. Towering trees with thick canopies cast shifting shadows, and the air hums with the distant calls of massive beasts. The ground beneath their feet is soft with moss, but the peace of the scene is shattered by the sound of cracking branches and heavy footsteps._

_Ahead, Sidewinder sits astride his massive crab mount, its carapace glistening with moisture. He glances back at the party, his glowing eyes narrowing as he tightens his grip on the crab’s reins. The crab lets out a low, guttural growl, its massive claws snapping menacingly._

**Sidewinder**: _His voice carries a cold, commanding tone._  
"I see you couldn’t leave well enough alone. You’ve sealed Ylgramox, but that victory will be short-lived. This place? It’s untamed, pure—just as the sea once was. Here, I will rebuild my strength. But you, you’ve chased me to my sanctuary, and for that, you’ll pay in blood."

_He raises a clawed hand, pointing it at the party as his crab shifts beneath him, ready for battle._


###### **80% HP** (Confident and Mocking)

_Sidewinder rides atop his giant crab, his claws snapping as he laughs mockingly._

**Sidewinder**:  
"You think you can best me in my domain? Foolish land-dwellers! The sea will claim you as it has so many others!"

_As one of his attacks lands solidly:_  
**Sidewinder**:  
"Did you feel that? The tide turns, and it’s not in your favor!"

_After dodging or shrugging off a spell:_  
**Sidewinder**:  
"Is that all you’ve got? Pathetic!"

---

###### **50% HP** (Cautiously Defiant)

_Sidewinder reels from a solid hit, his confident smirk fading into a determined scowl._

**Sidewinder**:  
"You’ve drawn blood... impressive. But the sea is endless, and its fury knows no bounds!"

_He grips the reins of his crab mount tightly as it roars, charging forward._

**Sidewinder**:  
"My companion hungers. Let’s see how long you can last!"

_After a particularly strong counterattack:_  
**Sidewinder**:  
"You’ve forced my hand, but I’ve weathered worse storms than you!"

---

###### **30% HP** (Desperate and Vengeful)

_Sidewinder staggers, ichor dripping from his wounds. His breathing is heavy, but his resolve hardens._

**Sidewinder**:  
"You may think victory is near, but the tide will pull you under before this ends!"

_He snarls, directing his crab to lash out with renewed ferocity._

**Sidewinder**:  
"If I fall, I’ll drag you down with me!"

_After taking another hit:_  
**Sidewinder**:  
"This isn’t over! The sea never forgets, and neither will I!"

---

#### **Death** (Defiant to the End)

_Sidewinder collapses to his knees, his crab mount screeching before retreating into the forest. He glares at the party, defiance burning in his eyes even as life slips away._

**Sidewinder**:  
"You think this is a victory? Hah... fools. Vyra’s shadow... looms larger than you can imagine... "

_With one last shuddering breath, Sidewinder falls silent, his body stilling as the forest grows quiet._



#### The Battle

_The fight takes place in a dynamic environment filled with towering trees, tangled roots, and thick undergrowth. The party must contend with Sidewinder’s powerful crab mount, which uses its massive claws to smash and grapple. The terrain itself adds complexity, with hazards like uneven ground, falling branches, and aggressive wildlife drawn to the noise of battle._


- Sidewinder and his mount attack at the same time. **They do not share health.** 
- When Sidewinder hits 50% life, a **Giant Ape** will emerge from the trees and attack indiscriminately. 
	- *If the party is getting bodied, the ape will show up earlier and kill Sidewinder...*
- **Trees can be knocked over** anyone who passes a **DC 18 STR check.** Trees do 3d10 points of damage to anyone in a 30ft line, starting at the base of the tree. Recipients can make a DC12 Dex save to dodge and take no damage.

## Vyra's Monologue:  

_As the dust settles from the battle with Sidewinder, a faint, cold light begins to illuminate the chamber._

> Sylvain’s body begins to convulse. His skin tightens, stretching unnaturally. His height increases, his frame elongates, and his hair grows long and pale as moonlight. His once-familiar robes shift and writhe, transforming into tattered garments etched with dark runes. Before you stands the Mistress of Shadows herself—Vyra.

*She looks at you with a calm, calculated gaze, her lips curling into a faint, knowing smile.*

> "Ah, mortals. Did you think Thorne's clever little druid would slip through my grasp? You’ve been dancing in my shadow for months, unwitting pawns in a much greater game. And now, you stand here, triumphant... yet so ignorant of the stakes."

_Her voice is cold, each word dripping with contempt as she slowly paces forward, the air around her growing heavier._

> "These shards you carry, these so-called lunashards... They are fragments of something far greater. Once, they formed the heart of **Lupara**, the Moon Goddess. A being whose light guided the tides and whose very pulse kept the seas in harmony. But eons ago, your ancestors, the **Eldoran**, in their arrogance, slaughtered her. They ripped her heart from her chest and carved it into a massive crystal to power their empire, **Vesiliaura**. Vesi, the jewel of the world. With Lupara’s death, the seas recoiled in rage and despair, a chaotic torrent that could no longer be tamed."

_She pauses, her eyes darkening as her voice grows sharper._

> "To the Eldoran, it was merely an inconvenience, a challenge to overcome. They sought greater power to bend the chaos to their will. I warned them. I begged them to stop. But arrogance knows no bounds. They didn't listen. **They NEVER listened!**"

_Her form flickers with echoes of ancient fire and ruin._

> "Our conflict reached its peak in the heart of Vesi. I tried to stop them, but in the end, I failed. Lupara’s Heart shattered in our struggle, and with it, their empire. The seas swallowed them whole, creating the eternal storm you know as **Vesi’s Rage**."

_Her voice lowers, filled with bitterness and venom._

> "I survived the destruction, though not unscathed. The explosion twisted me, body and soul, into what you see now. My purpose became clear: to ensure no one—_no one_—ever again seeks to wield the power of the gods. Your world is fragile, a pale shadow of its former self. But it is better this way. Humble. Grounded. Far beneath the heavens where it belongs."

_Her piercing gaze locks onto you, her tone darkening into a command._

> "And yet, here you are. Foolishly seeking to reforge the heart of a goddess. You think yourselves heroes, but you are no different from the Eldoran. Bold. Reckless. Dangerous."

_She raises her hand, and the chamber trembles, shadows swirling around her._

> "This time, I will not falter. I will drag your world back to the depths where it belongs. Prepare yourselves. If you continue to pursue me, you will join Sidewinder, the crabs, and all others who defied the balance."

_Her form begins to fade, her voice echoing with cold finality._

> "You can find me in Vesi, where it all began. That is where we will end this."

_The vision of Vyra flickers out, leaving the room silent and cold, an ominous reminder of what lies ahead._


## "Party, what you didn't notice was..."

### Vyra’s Replacement of Sylvain: The Deception

#### Sylvain’s Final Journey

> In the first session, Sylvain left the party with urgency, rushing to the Goblin Caves to rally their support against the looming threat. Through his diplomatic skill and bond with Grubnar Skull-Crusher, he managed to gain their trust. With the goblins agreeing to assist, Sylvain felt a renewed sense of purpose. 
> 
> He ran ahead of the goblin forces to return to town, eager to inform the party of the reinforcements. But as he neared the outskirts of the forest, a chilling presence stopped him in his tracks. Vyra emerged from the shadows, her form both imposing and graceful. She recognized the familiar attire of Elder Thorne and knew he would be troublesome.
> 
> Recognizing Sylvain as a threat to her plans, Vyra made a swift decision. In a battle that was over almost as quickly as it began, she overpowered him, ending his life. With Sylvain gone, Vyra used her shape-shifting abilities to take his form, seamlessly integrating herself into the party.

#### The Deception

> For the past few months, Vyra has traveled with the group, perfectly emulating Sylvain’s demeanor and druidic abilities. She guided them subtly, manipulating their decisions to align with her hidden agenda. 
> 
> She used this time to study the party, particularly their otherworldly origins, ensuring they gathered the Lunashards while staying just within the boundaries of her control.
> 
> During their trip to Castle Thorne, she took offense to Garos destroying the statues of her long forgotten kin. 
> 
> During their visit to Elder Thorne, she met with Thorne in private and closed the door behind herself. The party immediately left before anyone noticed that Thorne had been murdered. 
> 
> During their visit with the Willowhart sisters, the sisters seemed colder than usual towards Sylvain. It's possible they knew, but feared for their safety if they confronted her. Lila said as much in Eboncrest. 
> 
> During the parties travels to meet Mazerisha, Sylvain continued to act cold, calculated, and increasingly racist towards anyone who was not Eldoran descent. 
> 
> Vyra made seemingly real connections with both Garos and Posidinous as they adventured together. Sharing comradery and power. But never secrets. 
> 
> Her disguise was flawless, and her knowledge of Sylvain’s relationships and habits allowed her to deceive even those closest to him. She played the role of the supportive druid, contributing to the group’s victories and earning their trust. But her true purpose was always in the shadows, steering the group toward her own ends.

## The Chamber of Tides: Discovery on Sidewinder’s Corpse  

#### Scene Description  

*The forest stirs. You notice that Sidewinder’s lifeless body lies sprawled on the forest floor, his claws twitching in a final reflex before stilling.*

**Perception Check (DC 12)**:  
- Players notice a faint, otherworldly glow emanating from a pouch strapped to Sidewinder’s waist.  
- If no one passes the check, the glow intensifies over time, drawing their attention eventually.  

---

#### Discovery of the Chamber  

*Upon opening the pouch, the party finds an object unlike anything they’ve seen before: a large, crystalline fragment shaped like a curved chamber of a heart. Its surface shimmers with an iridescent, oceanic hue, and when touched, it feels as if the tides themselves pulse beneath its surface.*  

**The Chamber of Tides**  
- **Appearance**: A translucent blue fragment, roughly the size of a large book. Intricate patterns resembling flowing water are etched into its surface.  
- **Effect**: As soon as a player picks it up, they feel a rush of power, as if connected to the ebb and flow of the seas.  

---

### Immediate Effects  

1. **Divine Insight**:  
   *The player holding the chamber experiences a brief vision.*  
   - They see a vast ocean under a silver moon, its waves gently caressing the shores of a forgotten city.  
   - A faint whisper echoes in their mind:  
     **“The tides remember... and they guide those who listen.”**  
   - This grants the party a general sense of where the next chamber might lie—vague clues pointing toward a **mountain monastery** under a crescent moon.  

2. **Environmental Reaction**:  
   - The nearby forest springs to life briefly, with small streams of water surging through the roots, and local fauna appearing calmer. This signals the power of the chamber awakening.  

---

### Lore Unveiled  

**Arcana/Religion Check (DC 14):**  
Players can piece together information about the chamber’s significance:  
- The chamber is a piece of Lupara’s divine heart.  
- It holds the essence of her control over tides and the balance of the seas.  
- Reuniting this with the other chambers could restore the Moon Goddess’s power.  

## Players Next Steps

- Hopefully they ask the Necklace ([[Aelorian's Essence]]) for information on this heart. He'll tell them that there are 5 chambers of the heart. 
	- Alternatively, Talos could give them this information. 
- They should learn the names of all 5 chambers. 
- They should notice that the chamber they currently have gives them a sense of direction for where the closest one might be. The chambers want to be together. 

### Dialogue for Learning About the Five Chambers (Aelorian's Essence)

**Aelorian**:  
"Ah, you’ve found it... a Chamber of Lupara’s Heart. Her divine essence, shattered in the cataclysm that tore the world asunder... We were fools for trying to harness it... fools for murdering her... Now that you seem to be on the right track, I pray you can right our wrongs and put me to rest once more.. I'll do what I can to help. "

_The voice grows somber, almost reverent._

"There are five such chambers, each representing a vital aspect of her being. Only by reuniting them can you hope to restore what was lost."

_The necklace pulses with light as it lists the chambers._

1. **The Chamber of Tides**: "The flow and pull of the oceans, the breath of life within the seas."
2. **The Chamber of Reflection**: "The moon’s light, guiding dreams and introspection."
3. **The Chamber of Storms**: "Her fury, the tempest that guards and punishes."
4. **The Chamber of Serenity**: "Her calm, a soothing balm for chaos and strife."
5. **The Chamber of Blood**: "The core of her divinity, the pulse that sustained balance."

_Aelorian pauses, and the party feels a faint tug, a sense of direction._

**Aelorian**:  
"Do you feel it? The chambers yearn to be whole again. This fragment will guide you to the nearest one, for they call to each other across the fabric of this world. Heed its pull, and you will find your path."
