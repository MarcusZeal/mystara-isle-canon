## Recap 

**Sessions 13 - 15 Recap:** 

- The party arrived in **Undertow**, a coastal town on the island of **Saru**. There, they met **Tappa Tapp**, an elven saleswoman, who provided them with a magical treasure map tied to an annual competition.  
- At dawn, the map revealed the name **“Rampant Pegasus”** and new coordinates. The party set off in pursuit.  
- On the way, they encountered a group of pirates whom **Sylvain** had insulted at the inn. After a well-placed fireball, their ship and crew were obliterated—except for **First Mate Zeddaluf**, who fled into the ruins below.  
- The party followed him into the entrance of ancient underwater ruins, driven by the treasure map and a growing sense of greed.  
- Inside, they discovered **lunashards** (small glowing lamps).  
- **Snappy** (aka Renny) attacked **Posidinious**, who floated Snappy in the air for 10 minutes as a lesson. Snappy didn't bring it up again.  
- Later, Snappy was thrown into the ocean and died.  
- **Eldric** became enchanted by a mermaid statue, slowly transforming into a crabman.  
- **Garos**, **Sylvain**, and **Posidinious** cleared out nearby crabs in the dungeon.  
- Garos found an elderly crabman resembling himself. He killed the old man, stole his staff, and convinced the crabfolk he was their elder. Garos rallied them to revolt against their leader, **Sidewinder**.  
- The mob and the party stormed the capital, crossing a narrow bridge to a courtroom. There, they found two bells and Sidewinder. Seeing their betrayal, Sidewinder rang the **Bells of Ylgramaxillian**, summoning a leviathan from the depths.  
- **Ylgramaxillian** slaughtered the peaceful crabfolk protesters, but Sylvain cast a forbidden spell, summoning 8 pixies. The pixies transformed the party into **Giant Gorillas** and **Mastodons**, enabling them to defeat the leviathan.  
- The battle is over. The party is exhausted, but **Sidewinder** and Zeddaluf remain at large.
