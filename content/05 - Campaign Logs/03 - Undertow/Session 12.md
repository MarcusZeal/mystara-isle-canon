**NOTE: Remember that Eldric slept with Tappa Tapp.**



Recap: 

> The party arrived in **Undertow**, a coastal town nestled on the island of **Saru**. As they stepped off the docks, they were greeted by Tappa Tapp, an elven saleswoman with a gleam in her eye. She tried to sell them a map—one they had a coupon for—but instead demanded 100GP. Rather than using the coupon, Eldric charmed his way past the deal.
> 
> Meanwhile, in the shadows of Undertow, **Mazerisha** and **Theadora** forged connections in the more unsavory parts of town, trading goods and parting with Sylvain's ancient heirloom.
> 
> Later that evening, the group found themselves at the local inn, where Sylvain’s temper flared, leading to a clash with the captain of the **Krakentooth**. Magic intervened before things escalated further.
> 
> At the same time, Eldric’s charm worked wonders once again, leading him into an intimate encounter with both Tappa Tapp and the navigator.
> 
> The first light of dawn touches the horizon, and as it does, the map in your hands flickers and shifts, showing a small, jagged island to the northwest. The name **“Rampant Pegasus”** appears, along with an image of a shipwreck, half-buried beneath the waves. A sense of anticipation hangs in the air—this is what you’ve been waiting for.



## Act 2: The Competition Begins

#### **The Map Reveals the Location at Dawn**

As dawn breaks, the map glows with magical energy, revealing the location of the **Rampant Pegasus** wreck in **Typhoon Bay**, a perilous area surrounded by jagged rocks and known for its dangerous currents.

#### **Skill Challenges for Navigation**

Before the players reach the wreck, they must navigate the dangerous waters leading to **Typhoon Bay**. This part of the Sea of Vodari is notorious for sharp reefs, strong currents, and sudden fog banks.

- **Survival (DC 13)**: The party can navigate safely through the bay with Braw’s assistance. A failure means they scrape against a reef, causing minor hull damage to the **Boatussy**. Players must then perform repairs or risk further damage.
  
- **Nature (DC 12)**: Recognizing signs of an incoming storm or turbulent waters can help the party avoid dangerous weather. With a success, they adjust their sails and rigging to maintain control. Failure means they are caught in rough seas, slowing their progress and disorienting them.

- **Perception (DC 14)**: The party notices something strange beneath the water—large shadows moving just beneath the surface, hinting at something alive in the depths. Failure to spot this might result in a surprise attack later from the sea creatures or werecrabs.

#### **The Krakentooth Appears**

As the party approaches the wreck’s location, the **Krakentooth**—a fearsome brigantine with tattered sails and a kraken-like figurehead—appears from behind the rocky island, cutting off the **Boatussy**'s approach. The ship belongs to a crew of rival treasure hunters who are intent on claiming the wreck for themselves.

> Out of the morning mist, a dark shape emerges from behind the jagged rocks. The **Krakentooth** sails in silence, its black sails catching the early light. The crew stands ready, weapons drawn, as the ship pulls alongside the **Boatussy**. Captain Yoi stands at the bow, grinning. "Looks like we’re not the only ones after the treasure. Let’s see if you’ve got the guts to take it."

### **The Krakentooth Combat**

The **Krakentooth** immediately engages the party in combat. 



#### **Phase 1: The Grappling Hooks**

The **Krakentooth** crew first tries to close the gap between ships using grappling hooks and ropes, intending to board the **Boatussy** and engage in hand-to-hand combat. 

- **Skill Challenge**:
  - **Strength (Athletics) (DC 12)**: Players can attempt to cut the grappling hooks or push off boarding enemies before they gain a foothold. Each success reduces the number of boarders that make it across to their ship.
  - **Dexterity (Acrobatics) (DC 13)**: Alternatively, players can leap onto the **Krakentooth** themselves, turning the tables and attacking the enemy on their own ship. Successful players will face off with the **Krakentooth** crew directly.

---

#### **Phase 2: Boarders Attack**

Once the boarding action begins, the **Krakentooth** crew—led by **Captain Yoi "Flathorn"** and **First Mate Zeddaluf**—engages in fierce combat. The enemy crew consists of tough melee fighters and one powerful spellcaster.

##### **Captain Yoi "Flathorn"** (*Elf Warrior*):
- **Appearance**: A tall, lithe satyr with curling horns and a wicked grin. She wields a magical cutlass and moves with unnerving speed.
- **Combat Tactics**: Captain Yoi uses her agility and charm to taunt and manipulate her foes. Her cutlass, **Anchorhook**, allows her to pull enemies closer or disarm them.
  - **Taunt (Bonus Action)**: Yoi can target a player within 30 feet and force them to make a **Wisdom Save (DC 14)** or be taunted, causing them to focus on her for the next turn.
  - **Anchorhook (Attack)**: Yoi’s cutlass can pull a target within 20 feet toward her. The target must make a **Strength Save (DC 15)** to resist. If pulled, the target is grappled.

**Dialogue**:  
- "Come on, is that the best you’ve got? I thought this was supposed to be a *challenge*!"
- "This treasure’s mine, but I don’t mind sharing... your corpse with the sea."

##### **First Mate Zeddaluf** (*Elf Mage*):
- **Appearance**: A gaunt, hooded figure with glowing, arcane tattoos. He stays back from the melee, casting spells to control the battlefield.
- **Combat Tactics**: Zeddaluf specializes in disabling the party with spells like **Hold Person** and **Web**, using **Magic Missile** to target vulnerable characters.
  - **Hold Person**: Zeddaluf targets the party’s fighter or tank, trying to immobilize them while the crew swarms them.
  - **Magic Missile**: He focuses on spellcasters or healers to whittle down their health and break concentration.

**Dialogue**:  
- "Let’s see how you handle real power, mortals."
- "You’ve walked right into your own demise. Perfect."

##### **Krakentooth Crew (4 Pirates)**:
- **Tactics**: The crew focuses on trying to isolate and overwhelm individual party members, working in pairs to flank and grapple. They attempt to push weaker characters toward the edge of the ship to throw them overboard.
