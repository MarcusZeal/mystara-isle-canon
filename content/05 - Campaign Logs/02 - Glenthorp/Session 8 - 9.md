## Why Are We Here
### Quest Hook: From Castle Thorne to Mother Medusa

**Introduction through Aelorian Memories:**

As the adventurers explore the depths of Castle Thorne, they stumble upon an ancient chamber. The walls are covered in intricate carvings, and at the center stands a pedestal holding an ancient, serpent-skinned tome. As they touch the tome, Aelorian memories flood their minds, revealing a hidden history.

---

**Aelorian Memories:**

> *“Many centuries ago, the powerful faction of snakefolk known as the Vrael held dominion over vast lands, their rule enforced by a royal family of medusas. The Mistress of Shadows, Vyrra, seeing an opportunity to manipulate power, approached the medusa family with gifts: cursed artifacts known as the Bands of the Forked Tongue.”*

> *“The medusa siblings, intoxicated by their own power, eagerly accepted Vyrra’s gift, unaware of the true consequences. The Bands amplified their petrifying abilities but also whispered insidious thoughts, pushing them towards greater cruelty and paranoia. Mazerisha, the youngest princess, was horrified by her siblings' actions and sought a different path.”*

> *“Vyrra, anticipating the internal conflict, had given the cursed artifacts with a deeper intent. She knew the medusas' increasing cruelty would lead to their downfall, thereby weakening the Vrael's hold on the land. Mazerisha’s attempts to change her family’s ways only branded her a traitor in their eyes. In a bid to force her compliance, her siblings shackled her with the cursed bracelets.”*

> *“The bands not only made her petrifying gaze uncontrollable but also filled her mind with the vile whispers of her own snake-like hair. Desperate to escape the madness, Mazerisha fled, only to encounter a sect of dwarven paladins who saw her plight as a means to undermine the medusa family's tyranny.”*

> *“The dwarves built a sanctuary to protect and monitor Mazerisha, hoping she might one day help end the Vrael's oppression. However, the Vrael, led by her corrupted siblings, attacked the sanctuary. Mazerisha, already fragile, was pushed over the edge when her uncontrollable gaze turned her new allies to stone. In despair, she lashed out until the dwarves, to protect her and others, placed her into a deep magical slumber within the sanctuary.”*

> *“Years turned into centuries, and the sanctuary, hidden and forgotten, became overgrown as the memory of Mazerisha faded into legend. The once-proud medusa family fell into obscurity, victims of their own hubris and Vyrra’s cunning machinations.”*

**Elara Willowhart:**

> “This discovery is troubling. If the tome is correct, then the curse you’ve just lifted may be connected to an even greater danger... Elder Thorne told me the story of Mazerisha. The medusa who, despite her kind nature, was cursed with a wicked family by the Mistress of Shadows. 
> 
> He spoke of the Bands of the Forked Tongue, cursed shackles given to Mazerisha’s siblings by the Mistress of Shadows, to corrupt their minds and drive them to cruelty.
>
> To protect her, and the people around her, Mazerisha was placed into a deep slumber by the dwarves, hidden away in a sanctuary near the foot of the mountains on the edges of the Crimson Sands.
> 
> I heard at the Minotaur's Milk that recently, excavations near a Glenthorp may have disturbed something... I wonder if that's related! I heard that the Vrael, her snakefolk followers, have begun to be spotted once again..
> 
> Please. You must travel to Glenthorp and put an end to this. If Vyra really was at the heart of this then we must find a way to free Mazerisha from her curse. 
> 
> Take this map, it will guide you to Glenthorp, and perhaps the sanctuary. Be cautious, the Vrael are cunning and the curse has twisted the very land itself. May the light guide you in this dark endeavor.”

## Session 8

> Between the Tomb you found in Castle Thorne, the notes and directions you received from the Elves, you made your way to Glenthorp Island. 
> 
> Here, you found the town had been ravaged by Vrael, snake-like people. 
> 
> You learned that the attacks have been going on for some time (about 10 days), and that any villagers who went missing, sometimes would come back to help attack. 
> 
> You learned that there was an excavation site where all these vrael appear to be coming from. 
> 
> When you reached the excavation site, there was no sign of life anymore. The crew either dead or gone. 
> 
> You began to enter the old excavated well....
