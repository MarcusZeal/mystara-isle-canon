### Narrative Recap 

> During your celebrating in North Lodge, you were each gifted an item of extreme power from the villagers of North Lodge. These were your reward and you got the impression that they weren't all that impressive to the townspeople themselves. Curious since each weapon or item  is stronger than anything any of you could have imagined from your life on earth.
> 
> Once well rested and attuned to your new items, you set out towards Eboncrest. 
> 
> On the road you interacted with [[Aelorian's Essence]], the sentient necklace. The necklace told you of the [[01. The Golden Age of the Eldorans]] as well as a little bit about these Lunashards. 
> 
> Later, you met a shifty traveler. He started asking about Lunashards and if you've seen any. You thought Ren might have eaten one. You guys got a bit murderhobo-y on him and sent him away terrified of the other travelers on this road.
> 
> When entering Eboncrest, you met a little girl who had lost her mom. Without any coaxing whatsoever you helped her find her way back to her mom at the Minotaur's Milk, the only Inn in the city. 
> 
> At the Inn, you met up with [[Elara Willowhart]], where Sylvain told her about all that had transpired. Elara didn't seem to be particularly worried about the situation, but did ask them to come over to her shop to discuss it further. 
> 
> At her shop, [[The Whispering Willow]], you met her little brother and learned a bit more about how Vyrra was just a ghost story the elves used to tell their children. She seemed concerned and relieved about the events that transpired at North Lodge and asked you to investigate the Curse of Castle Thorn shortly. 
> 
> She also mentioned you should stop by the Adventurers Guild to register as adventurers on your way out of town. Sylvain was not interested at all. The party begrudgingly registered at the interest of Garos. You didn't all use your real names here... And now those fake names, if you used them, are magically inscribed onto these adventurer badges. 
> 
> You rested for the night and headed out to Castle Thorn early the next morning. You left at roughly 6am. It's just about noon now. What do you do?

### Why Are There Magical Portals In This Castle?


The ancient Eldorans used magical portals to get around. They were powered by refined lunashards. This castle miraculously is still functioning, having been so far away from ground zero of the catastrophe. 




### Encounter 1 : The Overgrown Village

#### Setting:

> As your party steps into the village at the base of the cursed castle, an unsettling atmosphere envelops you. The thick, twisting vines pulsing with a sinister life, the heavy scent of decay mingling with the sweet aroma of blooming flowers, and the unnatural shadows dancing in the flickering torchlight all set the stage for an eerie adventure.
> 
> The distant, mournful wail echoing through the empty streets. It's enough to sends chills down your spine. The overgrown vegetation rustles quietly, whispering secrets and warnings, while the soft glow from the village well casts an eerie light on the surrounding buildings, making them appear almost ghostly.


... (wait to see if the party does anything)

> Every step you take is met with the crunch of leaves and bones underfoot, a grim reminder of the village's fate. In the silence, you can almost hear the heartbeat of the cursed forest, slow and ominous. Faint moans and rustling leaves make it hard to distinguish between the living and the dead.

... (wait to see if the party does anything)

> Suddenly, Thistle lets out a small cry as he nicks himself on a thorn. As if in response, a figure emerges from the shadows, covered in blooming roses that contrast starkly with the open wounds on his body. He's not looking directly at you.

... (wait to see if the party does anything)

> With swift, calculated movements, the Rose Knight dispatches a nearby zombie, petals flying with each strike. Blood and sap mix as the defeated zombie collapses, leaving the Rose Knight standing tall and victorious, but it's clear that he's a little worse off. 
> 
> The Rose Knight approaches the well, his hands trembling slightly as he cups the glowing water to his lips. As he drinks, a loud, resonant humming emanates from the well, the sound growing in intensity. His wounds begin to close, roses blooming anew from the healed flesh. The humming from the well reverberates through the village.

... (wait to see if the party does anything)

> Zombies, drawn by the sound, shuffle towards the plaza, their eyes fixed on the well and its mysterious drinker. The air becomes tense, the silence broken only by the relentless humming and the shuffling of approaching zombies. The Rose Knight stands ready, his eyes fierce, as the undead close in on the glowing well. 

...

> Although it was a close battle, the undead overtake the rose knight. 4 stand over the rose knight's body, tearing it apart.

...

>  At this moment, a man steps out of the shadows across from you. He wears a form-fitting, dark blue leather armor that blends seamlessly with his shark-like skin, providing both protection and mobility. The armor is intricately decorated with silver runes and symbols of his order, glowing faintly with magical energy.
> 
> Over his armor, he dons a dark, weathered cloak with a high collar, the inside lined with a deep, crimson fabric. This cloak billows around him, adding to his imposing presence. Strapped across his back is a finely crafted, unique blade, its hilt adorned with small, intricately carved roses and runes.
> 
> Over his shoulder, he wears a belt laden with various pouches and tools. A small, intricately carved compass dangles from one of the pouches.
> 
> Lastly, you notice a small silver pendant around his neck engraved with a strange symbol none of you recognize, but it looks like a moon. 
> 
> Without a word, the man draws his blade and he moves with precise, practiced grace, dispatching zombies with swift, lethal strikes. Petals and blood mix in the air as each zombie falls, his movements a blur of deadly efficiency.

...

> The people of this town cannot be saved, but we can do them the courtesy of sending them on to their next life. My name is **Zephyr**. I am a Voda Bloodhunter. Help me cleanse this castle.



#### The Well of Vitality:
- Any creature using an action to drink from it regains 1d8+2 hit points and restores one 1st-level spell slot (if applicable).
- The well has 5 charges that replenish at dawn.

#### Enemies: Plant Zombies
Use the standard Zombie stat block with these modifications:
- **Type:** Plant instead of Undead
- **Speed:** 20 ft.
- **Sense Vibration:** The plant zombie can detect the presence of any moving creature within 30 feet through vibration.
- **Sound Sensitivity:** The plant zombie is blind but has keen hearing. It can only target creatures it can hear.

**AC:** 8
**HP:** 22 (3d8 + 9)
**Speed:** 20 ft.

**STR:** 13 (+1), **DEX:** 6 (-2), **CON:** 16 (+3), **INT:** 3 (-4), **WIS:** 6 (-2), **CHA:** 5 (-3)

**Saving Throws:** WIS +0
**Damage Immunities:** Poison
**Condition Immunities:** Poisoned
**Senses:** Blindsight 30 ft. (blind beyond this radius), Passive Perception 8

**Undead Fortitude:** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

**Actions:**
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage.


#### Mechanics:
1. Plant zombies only activate and move when they hear movement within 30 feet.
2. Players can attempt to move silently with a DC 12 Stealth check. On success, they don't trigger nearby zombies.
3. Loud actions (e.g., combat, shouting) automatically alert all zombies in a 60-foot radius.
4. The well glows softly, attracting attention. When a player drinks from it, there's a magical chime sound that alerts nearby zombies.


### Encounter 2: The Castle

- A massive wooden doors lays broken on the ground with part of the wall collapsed in on itself - revealing a grand entryway filled with the faint scent of roses and decay. The door
- Rose Guards, their armor entwined with thorny vines, stand sentinel, their eyes cold and unwelcoming.
- A rustling noise above catches your attention, and you spot a floating, beholder-like creature, its eye stalks swaying menacingly.

...

- As you draw closer, the creature reveals itself as a Gas Spore, its surface pulsating with dangerous spores.

...

- The walls of the castle are covered in creeping vines, with roses blooming eerily in the dim light.

...

- The air is thick with tension as the Rose Guards move to intercept you, their weapons at the ready.
- Every step echoes ominously, the sound swallowed by the castle's dark, sprawling corridors.
- The Gas Spores drift silently, their grotesque forms almost blending into the castle's shadowy recesses.
- The castle's oppressive atmosphere weighs heavily on you, each breath tasting of mold and ancient secrets.
- From deep within the castle, a low, rhythmic thrum can be heard, as if the very walls were alive and breathing.

As they explore the castle, they'll find Rose Guards and Rose Mages  and **Gas Spores.**

### Encounter 3: The Council of Thorns

- Four imposing thrones encircle the well, each one radiating a distinct seasonal elemental energy: summer, winter, fall, and spring.
- The air crackles with magic, the energies from the thrones intertwining and pulsing towards the well.
- In each corner of the chamber, a shimmering portal stands, humming softly with magical energy.
- The portals are arranged like the points of a plus sign, creating a pathway to the opposite sides of the room.
- The portals’ surfaces ripple like water, giving glimpses of the opposite side of the room as if seen through a distorted lens.

### Encounter 4: The Verdant Tyrant

#### Setting:

- The vast throne room is a tangled jungle of massive vines that cover the walls and ceiling, pulsating with malevolent energy.
- In one corner, a pool of acidic sap bubbles ominously, its fumes adding a noxious edge to the air.
- Spore-releasing flowers dot the room, their toxic pollen drifting lazily through the air like a sinister mist.
- The walls are alive with creeping vines that seem to writhe and shift, as if guided by an unseen will.
- The throne itself is nearly obscured by a thick web of vegetation, a dark figure barely visible within the tangled mass.
- As you step into the room, the ground squelches beneath your feet, the roots and plants reacting to your presence.
- A heavy, oppressive air fills the chamber, thick with the scent of decay and the sweet, cloying odor of blooming flowers.
- The dim light filtering through the overgrowth casts eerie shadows that dance and flicker across the room.
- Every breath you take feels tainted by the spores, the air itself a weapon in this living nightmare.
- The Verdant Tyrant, a monstrous figure entwined with vines and flowers, sits upon the throne, its eyes glowing with a malevolent green light.

### 12. Botanical Study

> _“Descending the stairs brings you to a chamber filled with books, vials and strange instruments. The sweet scent of the flowers further in the chamber mixes with a biting scent that clings to the back of your throat. Clearly many alchemical components are present here, presenting a danger to careless hands.”_

- Samples of the various experiments that were conducted here are still present, as well as many alchemical components, books on both botany and alchemy, instruments of all sorts and scrolls filled with strange arcane symbols.
- One versed in both matters of the arcane and the study of nature could work many wonders here or create more terrible magical concoctions.

**If the players search the bookshelves and research bench, they can find:**

##### The Rise and Fall of the Vrael
  ![[The Rise and Fall of the Vrael]]
##### A Partially Torn World Map (Hook to WC and the open world)
  ![[Bottom-Left.jpg]]

##### You find a crumpled piece of parchment
among the old books and alchemical equipment in the basement. The handwriting is hurried but legible:

> To whomever finds this, 
> 
> I must confess that I feel a deep shame for what we have done. The statue upstairs, the one molded after the great hero who once saved our village, hides more than just his likeness. Bound within the statue itself is his powerful weapon, a tool for good that could turn the tide against the darkness that has fallen upon us.    
> 
> It is tragic that such a powerful artifact is locked away, hidden in plain sight, when it could be used to protect and save our people. The hero it was modeled after would never have wanted it to be kept like this. He believed in action, in fighting for what is right, and in using his gifts to make the world a better place.    
> 
> If you have found this note, I implore you to go upstairs and investigate the statue. The weapon bound within it could be the key to restoring hope to this cursed place.
> 
> May you succeed where we have failed.

##### Research Notes mentioning about Lunashards
> To those who may come after,
> 
> I write this with a heavy heart and a mind burdened by concern. I fear the Lunashards are becoming scarce. And, with Vyra's rise to power, I fear for the future. She has shown a dangerous ambition, one that could lead to disastrous consequences. There are whispers that she might do something rash, something that could involve the royals. I hope with all my being that she refrains from any such actions.
> 
> The Lunashards are already rare, and if Vyra's plans lead to further conflict, we could face a dire shortage. This would not only cripple our constructs but also weaken our defenses against the looming threats. The balance we have maintained for so long is fragile, and any disruption could spell catastrophe.
> 
> If you find this note, please understand the gravity of the situation. The power of the Lunashards must be preserved, and our actions must be measured and wise. 
> 
> May wisdom guide us through these dark times.

##### Piranha Potion Recipe

>  **Ingredients:**
> 	- 3 Royal Roses
> 	- 1 Verdant Dragon Scale
> 	- 1 Gaseous Spore 
> 	- 1 Ophiocordyceps Unilateralis Stroma 
> 	- Arcane Knowledge
> 
> **Steps:** 
> 
> 1. Carefully grind all dry ingredients together to make a fine powder. 
> 2. Slowly pour dry ingredients with magically infused water from one of Castle Thorn's fountains. 
> 3. Bring mixture to a boil while slowly infusing with arcane. 
> 
> **Be VERY careful. I shouldn't have to tell you just how dangerous the Piranha Potion could be in the wrongs hands.** And if you fail any of these steps, you'll likely create another rogue Awdreetoo... so be ready to deal with that if your competence is not your forte. 

###### Craft That Potion

If the players attempt to do some alchemy here send them through a skill check gauntlet. If they succeed, they'll create the [[Piranha Potion]].

Creating a super powerful potion should be a challenging and rewarding process. Here is a detailed progression with three very difficult skill checks:

###### Stage 1: Gathering Rare Ingredients

- **Skill Check:** Nature (or Survival)
- **DC:** 18
- **Description:** "You need to locate and gather rare ingredients from the dangerous and magical areas surrounding the castle. This requires an in-depth knowledge of the local flora and a keen eye for detail."
- **Success:** "You successfully identify and gather the rare ingredients needed for the potion. These ingredients are crucial for the potion's potency."
- **Failure:** "You struggle to find the right ingredients and end up with a mixture of common plants. You can try again after spending more time searching, but it will delay the process."

###### Stage 2: Brewing the Base Potion

- **Skill Check:** Arcana (or Alchemist's Supplies proficiency)
- **DC:** 20
- **Description:** "You must carefully brew the base potion, ensuring that the magical properties of the ingredients are correctly extracted and combined. This requires precise control over the brewing process and a deep understanding of magical alchemy."
- **Success:** "You manage to brew the base potion perfectly, creating a strong foundation for the super powerful potion."
- **Failure:** "The potion mixture starts bubbling uncontrollably, and you have to quickly dispose of it to prevent an explosion. You will need to gather the ingredients again and start over."

###### Stage 3: Infusing with Magical Energy

- **Skill Check:** Arcana (or Spellcasting Ability)
- **DC:** 22
- **Description:** "The final step involves infusing the potion with a concentrated burst of magical energy. This requires channeling your magical power directly into the potion without destabilizing it."
- **Success:** "You successfully infuse the potion with magical energy, resulting in a super powerful potion that glows with an intense, magical light."
- **Failure:** "The infusion process goes awry, causing the potion to become volatile and lose its potency. You will need to brew a new base potion and try the infusion again. **One Awdreetoo spawns with half HP.** "
