#### The Aftermath and the Mistress’s Rise - Part 1


> But Vyra’s ambition was tainted by the same hubris that had led to our downfall. She delved into dark magics, binding her soul to the ancient powers that had destroyed us. In her quest for control, she became something more—and less—than Eldoran. She became the Mistress, a being of immense power and unrelenting ambition.
> 
> The Mistress’s influence began to spread, her minions infiltrating the far reaches of Eldrath. She orchestrated events from the shadows, manipulating destinies and sowing chaos to achieve her goals. Her vision was clear: to rebuild the Eldoran empire, to restore our lost glory, and to ensure that no one could ever challenge her power.
