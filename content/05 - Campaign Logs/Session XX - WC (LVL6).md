**Letter from Erisol Shyx:**

> *"Kai, my dear friend,*
>
> I hope this letter finds you well. I'm so sorry for the way we all acted in our last meeting. We were fools. You did everything you could to help us and we were fools to turn you away. If you read no further, just know that we - that I am sorry. And I thank you for all you did back then.
> 
>That has been weighing on me heavily over the past few months and when I stumbled upon an extraordinary opportunity I thought of you immediately. 
>
>There's a treasure hunt event happening in a seaside village near Dawnham to the south called Undertow. The event promises excitement and riches beyond imagination! Your cunning and way around boat might help tremendously! 
>
>Enclosed is a discount coupon for you. It's good for up to 8 people so bring your new friends if you've found any. 
>
> The village of Undertow is a quaint fishing town with friendly locals and breathtaking views. It’s the perfect place for us to catch up and embark on a thrilling adventure together. I've already arrived and can’t wait to see you here. This event could be just what we need to relive the good old days and perhaps even uncover something truly remarkable.

> *Your friend,*
> *Erisol Shyx"*
