**Dear Sarah, My Old Friend,**

I hope this letter finds you well. I have some news that I think you’d be interested to hear. Recently, our quiet village of [[North Lodge]] was saved from a dire threat by a group of remarkable adventurers. We were facing an invasion of changelings, and without their intervention, I shudder to think of what might have happened.

These brave souls stood their ground and fought with such tenacity and skill that they managed to turn the tide in our favor. Their courage and strength were a sight to behold, and I feel incredibly fortunate that they came to our aid.

I know you’d appreciate their story, and I thought you might want to extend your hospitality to them if they ever make their way to you. You’d be proud to hear what they’ve done for us. 

Looking forward to seeing you again soon,

**Gareth**

P.S. - You can give them the thing we worked on together if you ever finished it. I have a feeling they'll need it more than us...
