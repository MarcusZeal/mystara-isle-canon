### **15 A.C.: Rowan Thorne Leaves**

- **Vision:** You see a younger Rowan Thorne standing on the deck of a grand ship, the Elderbranch, staring out over the horizon. His face is set with determination, yet tinged with sorrow as he leaves his homeland behind. The ship sails away from the remnants of his family’s land, the sea vast and unknown before him. As the vision fades, Rowan whispers, _“There must be something more out there… something untouched by this darkness.”_



### **50 A.C.: Thomas Thorne Begins His Journey**

- **Vision:** You now see Thomas Thorne his eyes scanning ancient maps spread across a table. The scene shifts to him on a Boatussy Prime, navigating through treacherous waters. His voice echoes, _“I will find you, brother, no matter how far this world has scattered us.”_ The vision then shifts to show him sailing into uncharted territories, his determination unwavering.



### **500 A.C.: Rowan Thorne Settles in Silvertree**

- **Vision:** You witness Rowan arriving in the tranquil elven city of Silvertree, nestled deep within a mystical forest. He looks weary, yet relieved to find a place of peace after centuries of wandering. The elves greet him warmly, and he is seen spending years in quiet contemplation among the ancient trees, gaining wisdom and renewing his connection with nature.



### **800 A.C.: Rowan Moves to Mystara Isle**

- **Vision:** The scene changes to Rowan packing his few belongings, bidding farewell to the elves of Silvertree. You see him arriving on the shores of Mystara Isle, where he steps off the boat and gazes into the dense, untamed forests ahead. He whispers, _“This land… it feels like home.”_ The vision lingers on him disappearing into the woods, where he would eventually establish the foundation of a new life.



### **805 A.C.: Rowan Establishes Castle Thorne and a Village**

- **Vision:** The vision shifts to show Rowan standing on a coastal cliff, overlooking the vast ocean. He is surrounded by a group of elves who have joined him on this new journey. Together, they begin the construction of a grand castle—Castle Thorne—its towers rising proudly on the coastline. Below the castle, a small, peaceful village begins to take shape, nestled against the edge of the forest. Rowan oversees the construction, a sense of hope and renewal in his eyes. As time passes, more elves arrive, and the village flourishes under the protective shadow of the castle.



### **1500 A.C.: Vyrra Curses Castle Thorne**

- **Vision:** You are shown the darkened halls of Castle Thorne, where Vyrra stands in the center of a grand chamber, her eyes blazing with fury and sorrow. As she raises her hands, dark energy pulses through the castle, warping the stones and twisting the spirits within. The once-proud banners of the Thorne family rot away as a malevolent aura settles over the castle, ensuring that all who enter would be cursed. Her voice echoes, _“Let this place be a reminder of our sins… let none who dwell here find peace.”_ 
- The throne is twisted into portals, Rowan's council is turned into Thorne Knights. The village below falls into despair as the curse spreads, turning what was once a place of light into a shadowed memory. 
- The scene shifts to Rowan, standing outside of the village, drop his bounty of herbs and twigs to the ground as recognition creeps across his face. 



### **1500 A.C.: Thomas Thorne in Silvertree**

- **Vision:** You see Thomas Thorne, aged and tired, entering Silvertree. He speaks with the elves, asking about his brother, Rowan. The elves, with sorrowful expressions, inform him that Rowan had left centuries before, heading west toward Mystara Isle, seeking a new life. However, they add with a heavy heart that he has not been heard from since, and they fear he may have perished on his journey. Thomas's face falls as the realization dawns on him—his brother is likely dead. He stands beneath the towering trees, grief-stricken and filled with regret, murmuring, _“After all this time… I was too late.”_ The vision fades as Thomas turns away, the weight of loss heavy on his shoulders, though a flicker of hope remains that Rowan might still be found.



### **1500 A.C.: Rowan Abandons the Castle**

- **Vision:** You see Rowan Thorne, standing alone in the desolate remains of Castle Thorne. His shoulders are slumped, and his face is etched with sorrow as he realizes that he cannot save his ancestral home. The once-grand halls are now cold and filled with shadows, the weight of the curse heavy in the air. Rowan takes one last look at the crumbling walls, a silent farewell to his past, before turning away. 
- You watch as he moves westward through the wilds of Mystara Isle, leaving the cursed castle behind, its spires disappearing into the mist. The vision lingers on Rowan’s figure as he vanishes into the dense, untamed forest, seeking solace far from the place that once defined his family’s legacy.



### **1500 A.C.: Thomas’s Fate at Castle Thorne**

- **Vision:** The final vision shows Thomas Thorne reaching to Castle Thorne, older and more desperate. He enters the cursed castle, his face set with grim determination. You see him pen a letter to nobody and place it in library before he moves into the castle. Determination written on his face. 
- As he moves through the halls, shadows begin to close in around him. You see flashes of him battling unseen forces, the curse taking its toll. 
- The vision ends with a final, haunting image of Thomas Thorne falling to his knees in the great hall, overwhelmed by the darkness. His voice, filled with regret, whispers, _“Forgive me, Rowan… I couldn’t escape our past… none of us could…”_ before the vision fades to black.
