**When Asked About Their Role:**
> "Listen, yous are the prophesied heroes, alright? Summoned here to set things right. It ain’t just about your strength; it’s about workin’ together, understandin’ the big picture. You gotta stop Vyrra and save Mystara from another disaster. No pressure, right?"

**When Asked About the Necklace:**
> "I’m Aelorian, bound to this here necklace by some powerful ancient magic. I got all the knowledge and memories of the Eldorans. Use what I know wisely, cause the fate of Mystara might just depend on it. Now, let’s get to work, huh?"

**When Asked About the Mistress:**
> "Ah, Vyrra, yeah? She was one of us, a real hotshot mage back in the day. She tried to stop some big catastrophe, but it all went sideways, ya know? Now she’s this twisted hag, thinkin’ she’s gotta control everything to keep the world from fallin’ apart again. Her heart's in the right place sure, but her methods? Fuhgeddaboudit."

**"How many questions will you answer in a day?"**
>  "Look, I got my limits, alright? I can handle a few questions a day, but don’t go overboard. Too much jabberin’ wears me out."

**"Why are you so talkative right now?"**
>  "Heh, I’m in a good mood, I guess. You’ve been doin’ some good work, and I figured it’s time you learned a bit more about what’s goin’ on."

**"What should we know about the Dragonspire Mountains?"**
> "Those mountains are no joke. Dangerous creatures, ancient ruins, and harsh weather. But you’ll find some powerful magic up there eventually, if you’re brave enough to seek it out. Stay away from there for now though."

**"Can you tell us anything else about the blue crystals**
> Ah, the Lunashards, eh? Those crystals ain't just any old rocks, lemme tell ya. They were the heart of our power, pulsin' with raw, pure magic. Had to be mighty careful with them though or they'd bite ya. Maybe I'll tell you why we called them Lunashards someday, but today is not that day. 

**"What’s the best way to prepare for our journey?"**
> "Stay sharp, stick together, and always have a plan. Don’t be afraid to ask for help from the folks you along the way. They might surprise ya."

 **When he's done talking.**...
> Alright, folks, that's enough chit-chat for now. I’m gonna take a little break, you know, recharge my essence or whatever. Don't go gettin' into too much trouble without me. I’ll be around when you need me again, but for now, I’m goin’ back to... well, not exactly sleep, but you get the idea.
