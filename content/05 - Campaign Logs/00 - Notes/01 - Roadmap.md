   - To access it, they must seek ancient artifacts or rituals that can protect them from the storm.

4. **The Rise of Ylgramaxillian**  
   - The dragon Ylgramaxillian, whose power Vyra sought to unleash through Sidewinder, becomes a key threat.
   - The party faces a choice: defeat Ylgramaxillian to weaken Vyra’s hold or attempt to turn the dragon against her.
   - This arc serves as a prelude to the final confrontation, showing the true scale of Vyra’s ambitions.

5. **The Moonlight Ritual**  
   - The party discovers the ancient ritual needed to resurrect Lunara, but the process is incomplete without a specific component—Vyra herself.
   - They must decide whether to seek a way to convert Vyra’s essence into a catalyst for the ritual or confront her directly to reclaim the final power needed.

6. **The Final Journey to Vesi**  
   - With the Lunashards in hand, the party embarks on a perilous journey to Vesi’s Rage.
   - They must navigate treacherous waters, face storms, and battle sea monsters protecting the ruins.
   - Along the way, they encounter remnants of Eldoran technology and magic, including visions of their final days.

7. **The Battle of Vesi**  
   - In the ruins of Vesi, the party confronts Vyra for the final time.
   - The battle takes place across multiple phases, with Vyra using her mastery of dark and elemental magic, summoning shadow creatures, and manipulating the battlefield.
   - Environmental hazards like collapsing ruins, tidal waves, and shifting terrain add layers of complexity to the fight.

8. **The Choice**  
   - As the battle reaches its climax, the party faces a pivotal choice:  
     - Destroy Vyra and use the Lunashards to resurrect Lunara, restoring balance to the world.  
     - Attempt to redeem Vyra, convincing her to assist in the ritual and willingly give up her twisted existence.  
     - Forgo Lunara’s resurrection entirely, leaving the world as it is, but at peace for now.  

9. **Post-Battle Consequences**  
   - The world reacts to the party’s decision.  
   - If Lunara is resurrected, the seas calm, and balance is restored, but ancient forces may stir once more.  
   - If Vyra survives, she may either become an ally or a lingering threat.  
   - The party’s legacy becomes a defining chapter in Vodari’s history, shaping its future for generations.
