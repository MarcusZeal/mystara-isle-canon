## Narrative Recap

> After thwarting the Mistress's plan in North Lodge, our heroes ventured to Eboncrest where they met an elf by the name of Elara Willowhart, the Proprietor of The Whispering Willow. Elara is old friends with Sylvain and the sister of Lila Willowhart. 
> 
> Elara told our heroes of a dangerous curse that has been in place for many years, but has recently been spreading out of Castle Thorne, a castle to the south of Eboncrest. 
> 
> Also while in Eboncrest, the players joined the Adventurers Guild, a guild dedicated to helping match strong individuals with tasks that need their expertise. 
> 
> Our players ventured down to Castle Thorne the next day.  Although they suffered the loss of Thistle, they met a new ally, Zephyr. Together, they defeated the Council of Thornes as well as the Verdant Tyrant before finding their way to an old library under Castle Thorne itself. 
> 
> There, they found a number of old reports and tomes. One was a recipe for a very strong potion. Another was a Snake-Skin Tomb that spoke of a cursed princess by the name of Mazerisha. Another was the ramblings of an old king, whom you're pretty sure was the Verdant Tyrant you slew, asking you to take up his old ship and become the captain it deserves now that he can no longer be that. 
> 
> With the **Boatussy Prime** in hand, and the curse cleansed, the heroes returned back to Eboncrest to collect their rewards and let Elara know all that transpired in Castle Thorne. 


## Between Sessions

Some things happened between sessions. 

### Sylvain Speaks to Elara


- They spoke of Elder Thorne and his relation to Thomas Thorne. 
- They spoke of Vyra and Sylvain learned a bit more about where she came from - or at least someone who shared her name. 
- Sylvain shared the Rise and Fall of Vrael.

> This discovery is troubling. If the tome is correct, then the curse you’ve just lifted may be connected to an even greater danger… Elder Thorne told me the story of Mazerisha, the medusa who, despite her kind nature, was cursed with a wicked family by the Mistress of Shadows.
> 
> He spoke of the **Bands of the Forked Tongue**, cursed shackles given to Mazerisha’s siblings by the Mistress of Shadows, to corrupt their minds and drive them to cruelty.
> 
> To protect her and the people around her, Mazerisha was placed into a deep slumber by the dwarves, hidden away in a sanctuary island to the southeast. 

> I heard at the Minotaur's Milk that recent excavations on a small island, Glenthorp, may have disturbed something… I wonder if that's related! I’ve also heard that the Vrael, her snakefolk followers, have been spotted once again.
> 
> Take this map, it will guide you to Glenthorp and perhaps the sanctuary. Be cautious, the Vrael are cunning, and the curse has twisted the very land itself. May the light guide you in this dark endeavor.

> And Slvain, seeing you grow into the elf you are today has warmed my heart. But it's a big world out there. And I'm beginning to think it's bigger than either of us were lead to believe. 
> 
> Remember that not all of the other races are evil and even more than that, not all elves are good or kind. Living in Eboncrest all these years has taught me that the quality of someone's character is not outwardly visible at all. Be careful and be kind. 
> 
> Send me a message if you can, but if you cannot - take heart and come back in a few decades to tell me of your adventurers and the different kind of people you meet along the way. 

- Slyvain went to the Minotaur's Milk, went to bed, and leveled up to level 5.


### Garos Returns to the Adventurers' Guild

#### Marisella Voss Conversation

**Receptionist**: "Oh, you're back! Great to see you ag—wait, where's the rest of your team?"

**Receptionist**: "Oh no… I'm so sorry to hear that. Thistle was such a vibrant spirit. It’s never easy losing someone on a mission."

**Receptionist**: "And… wait a minute, I just realized there was no reward listed for that mission! That's a terrible oversight, especially for something so dangerous."

(She quickly starts flipping through some papers, frowning in concentration.)

**Receptionist**: "Let’s see… Okay, the guild has a compensation policy for unlisted rewards, especially in cases of such peril. I can authorize **300 gold pieces** per registered member of the guild. That’s not nearly enough for what you all went through, but I hope it helps just a little. And here - please take Thistle's cut as well."

(She offers a sincere smile, trying to bring a bit of warmth back to the moment.)

**Receptionist**: "Please, take care of yourselves. And if there's anything else you need, don’t hesitate to ask."


300 * 



### Eldric's Dreams:

**In Eldric's dreams he is confronted with a vision from Aelorian.** 

> *“Many centuries ago, the powerful faction of snakefolk known as the Vrael held dominion over vast lands, their rule enforced by a royal family of medusas. The Mistress of Shadows, Vyrra, seeing an opportunity to manipulate power, approached the medusa family with gifts: cursed artifacts known as the Bands of the Forked Tongue.”*
> 
> *“The medusa siblings, intoxicated by their own power, eagerly accepted Vyrra’s gift, unaware of the true consequences. The Bands amplified their petrifying abilities but also whispered insidious thoughts, pushing them towards greater cruelty and paranoia. Mazerisha, the youngest princess, was horrified by her siblings' actions and sought a different path.”*
> 
> *“Vyrra, anticipating the internal conflict, had given the cursed artifacts with a deeper intent. She knew the medusas' increasing cruelty would lead to their downfall, thereby weakening the Vrael's hold on the land. Mazerisha’s attempts to change her family’s ways only branded her a traitor in their eyes. In a bid to force her compliance, her siblings shackled her with the cursed bracelets.”*
> 
> *“The bands not only made her petrifying gaze uncontrollable but also filled her mind with the vile whispers of her own snake-like hair. Desperate to escape the madness, Mazerisha fled, only to encounter a sect of dwarven paladins who saw her plight as a means to undermine the medusa family's tyranny.”*
> 
> *“The dwarves built a sanctuary to protect and monitor Mazerisha, hoping she might one day help end the Vrael's oppression. However, the Vrael, led by her corrupted siblings, attacked the sanctuary. Mazerisha, already fragile, was pushed over the edge when her uncontrollable gaze turned her new allies to stone. In despair, she lashed out until the dwarves, to protect her and others, placed her into a deep magical slumber within the sanctuary.”*
> 
> *“Years turned into centuries, and the sanctuary, hidden and forgotten, became overgrown as the memory of Mazerisha faded into legend. The once-proud medusa family fell into obscurity, victims of their own hubris and Vyrra’s cunning machinations.”*



## Session 7 Begins...


## Meeting with Elder Thorne

### Scene Setting

The party arrives in Elder Thorne's secluded grove, a place where nature has been carefully nurtured, reflecting his deep connection to the wilds. The grove is peaceful, a stark contrast to the turmoil hinted at in the note from Thomas. Elder Thorne greets them with the calm presence of a druid who has lived through countless ages but still carries the quiet sorrow of his family’s legacy.

### Elder Thorne’s Dialogue

- **Elder Thorne:** (quietly, after reading) *"Thomas… always the last to give up on the past. Even now, he clings to the remnants of what we once were."*

- **Elder Thorne:** (a brief pause, as he looks to the distance) *"Vyrra… she wasn't wrong, you know. I see that now, after all these years. If only… If only we could have helped her before that day, perhaps everything would be different."* (He shakes his head, dismissing the thought.)

- **Elder Thorne:** *"Take the Elderbranch. Give it a new name, a new purpose. Let it carry you to where you must go, and may it be a vessel of hope, not of despair."* (He places a hand on the nearest party member’s shoulder) *"The world is in your hands now. Do what we could not."*

- **Body Language:** Elder Thorne may occasionally look away, as if lost in thought, or sigh quietly when he mentions his brother or Vyrra. He might absentmindedly touch a tree or plant, grounding himself in the present to avoid being overwhelmed by the past.
  

- **Elder Thorne:** *"Remember, not all that is old is meant to be forgotten. Sometimes, the past has lessons that can guide us… if we’re willing to listen."* (He gives them a final, meaningful look) *"Go with the blessings of the wilds, and may you find what you seek."*


## Set Sail and Into Glenthorp

The party set sail to the island of Glenthorp, where they met Elirath, a teifling who explained what had happened over the last 10 days. 


### What happened here?

"As far as we know, about ten days ago, Theodora arrived with impressive credentials. She quickly convinced our village's elders that she could carefully excavate the ritual water-well, which is about half a day's walk away, and determine who built it.

She promised to provide the village with all the treasure she found from the well after it was carefully cataloged, allowing the elders to decide what to do with it. Nearly thirty local farmhands were paid to assist with the excavation, and Theodora hired a group of mercenaries to protect the site from potential looters."

### When were you attacked?

"Three days ago, Theodora came rushing into the village, frantic and raving about a battle that had taken place at the excavation site. Before she could even finish explaining, the town was attacked. Several people were injured or dragged away during the assault. Shockingly, some of the attackers were the very farmhands who had been helping with the dig. We also saw a pair of snake-folk overpower several citizens.

After the attackers left, we prepared the village for the next night and sent out our fastest runners to seek help from the local area. However, we were attacked again over the next three nights. Those who were dragged away one night would return to attack us the next."


## Enter The Depths of the Excavation Site

You walked deep into the excavation site... The low tunnel continues downwards for almost
100-feet before ending in a stone staircase that descends into an open area with a fountain of blood in the center.
