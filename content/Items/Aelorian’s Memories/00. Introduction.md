Aelorian says the following when a person of a party attunes to it for the first time. It is assumed that everyone hears this message. **Aelorian is attuning to the party as a whole, not a single person.** 

Aelorian can be worn by any one member at any one time, but only a single member per session. 

#### The Golden Age of the Eldorans

>Greetings. I am Aelorian, an ancient scholar of Eldrath. By attuning to this amulet, you have accepted a responsibility greater than any mere trinket could bestow. Together, we shall uncover the secrets of the past, thwart the dark ambitions of the Mistress, and protect the world from the shadows that threaten it.
>
> I have witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, the power of ancient magic, and the cost of unchecked ambition. I offer you my wisdom, my guidance, and my unwavering support. But know this, our journey will not be easy. It will require courage, integrity, and a steadfast commitment to our cause.
> 
> Should you ever stray from the path of righteousness, I will withdraw my aid until you have atoned. I have seen the consequences of darkness and will not allow history to repeat itself.
> 
> Now, let us begin. Together, we will uncover the truths that lie hidden, and forge a path to a brighter future for all.
