**Captain Thorne,**

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. It’s been a while since we last spoke, and I wanted to share some news that you might find of interest. Recently, our peaceful village of North Lodge faced an unexpected and dangerous threat—an invasion of changelings.

In the midst of this crisis, a group of adventurers stepped up and defended our village with incredible bravery and skill. They fought off the changelings and saved countless lives. Their valor on the battlefield reminded me of the days when we served together, facing insurmountable odds and emerging victorious.

These heroes deserve recognition and support. If they ever come to Ironheart, I would appreciate it if you could extend to them the same camaraderie and respect we shared during our time in service. 

Their actions were nothing short of extraordinary, and I know you’d appreciate their story.

I hope to see you again soon and share more tales of their bravery. I have a feeling if these few live very long, they will be names known all over Mystara. 

With respect,

**Darius**

P.S. - You still owe me.
