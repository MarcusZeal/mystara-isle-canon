- **Value**: 1 Emerald worth 50gold pieces to a goblin craftsman near [[Grukthar Hollow]].
- **Description**: This is a small pouch filled with a fine, shimmering powder that goblins call "Sneaky-Sneaky Powder." The powder glitters faintly, like starlight caught in dust.
- **Properties**: When sprinkled over an object or person, it renders them invisible. However, the enchantment is fragileâ€”any movement, even the slightest wiggle, will cause the invisibility to break. Best used on inanimate objects or on people who can hold very, very still.
- **Usage**: The pouch contains 2 charges of Sneaky-Sneaky Powder. Each charge can be used to make a Medium or smaller creature or an object of similar size invisible. The invisibility lasts until the target moves.
- **Charges**: The pouch can contain up to 6 charges. 
- **Recharge**: The pouch regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. To recharge the pouch, it must be placed under the light of the moon for at least 1 hour.

**Mechanics**:
- **Invisibility**: The powder can be used to make a Medium or smaller creature or an object of similar size invisible. The invisibility lasts until the target moves.
- **Movement Breaks Invisibility**: Any movement by the invisible target, including breathing heavily or twitching, will immediately break the invisibility effect.
- **Limited Charges**: The pouch has 3 charges. Each use of the powder expends one charge.
- **Recharge**: The pouch regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. To recharge the pouch, it must be placed under the light of the moon for at least 1 hour.
