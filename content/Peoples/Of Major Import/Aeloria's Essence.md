#### Personality

Aeloria is wise, compassionate, and deeply committed to preventing the same mistakes that led to the downfall of the Eldorans.

#### Abilities and Features

**1. Knowledge of the Ancients**

Aeloria can provide valuable information about Eldoran history, ancient magic, and the Mistress's plans. Once per long rest, the wearer can ask Aeloria a question about these topics. Aeloria will answer truthfully to the best of her knowledge.

**2. Protective Aura**

Aeloria's Essence grants the wearer a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws. This bonus increases as the wearer levels up:
- Levels 1-9: +1 bonus
- Levels 10-14: +2 bonus
- Levels 15-17: +3 bonus
- Levels 18-20: +4 bonus

**3. Guiding Light**

As an action, the wearer can activate Aeloria's Essence to emit a soft, radiant light in a 30-foot radius. This light dispels magical darkness and grants advantage on saving throws against fear and charm effects to all allies within the radius. The light lasts for 10 minutes and can be used once per long rest.

**4. Ancient Wisdom**

Once per day, Aeloria can provide a flash of insight, allowing the wearer to reroll one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. The wearer must use the new roll.

**5. Progressive Revelation**

As the campaign progresses, Aeloria will reveal more about her past and the Mistress's plans. At key narrative points, she will share visions or memories that provide crucial information or context. This can include:
- **The Fall of the Eldorans**: Aeloria describes the events that led to the cataclysm and her own role in trying to prevent it.
- **The Mistress's Origin**: Insights into the Mistress's transformation and her motivations.
- **Ancient Rituals**: Knowledge of powerful rituals or spells that could aid the party in their quest.

**6. Aura of Threat**

The wearer of Aeloria's Essence appears more threatening to enemies. Enemies within 30 feet of the wearer must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 6 + the wearer's proficiency bonus + the wearer's Charisma modifier) at the start of each of their turns. On a failed save, they are compelled to focus their attacks on the wearer, if possible. 

This effect does not apply to creatures that cannot be charmed or those immune to fear.

#### Attunement

To attune to Aeloria's Essence, a character must spend a long rest meditating with the amulet, during which Aeloria will introduce herself and explain her purpose. Aeloria will only attune to a character who shares her commitment to stopping the Mistress and protecting the world of Eldrath.

---

#### Drawbacks

While Aeloria is generally supportive, she is deeply mistrustful of those who pursue power for its own sake. If the wearer engages in actions that Aeloria deems morally wrong or counterproductive to their shared goal, she may temporarily withdraw her support, causing the amulet to become inert until the wearer atones for their actions.

Aeloria's Essence serves as both a powerful magic item and a key narrative device, guiding the players and providing them with the tools and knowledge they need to confront the Mistress and uncover the deeper mysteries of their world.
