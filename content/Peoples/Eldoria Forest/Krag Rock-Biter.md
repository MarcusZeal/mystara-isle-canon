### Goblin Leader: Krag Rock-Biter

#### Description

- **Name**: Krag Rock-Biter
- **Role**: Goblin Leader
- **Appearance**: Krag is a fierce-looking goblin with dark green skin and a muscular build. He has sharp, jagged teeth, with one particularly large fang that appears to have been chipped and worn down from gnawing on rocks, giving him his name. His eyes are a piercing yellow, and he wears a patchwork of leather armor adorned with trophies from his victims.

#### Personality

- **Cunning**: Krag is highly intelligent and strategic for a goblin, capable of planning ambushes and traps that are more sophisticated than typical goblin tactics.
- **Ruthless**: He is known for his brutal methods and shows no mercy to enemies or even his own kind if they fail him.
- **Charismatic Leader**: Despite his ruthlessness, Krag has a certain charisma that commands loyalty from his goblin followers. He knows how to inspire fear and respect.

#### Background

- **Ritualistic Upbringing**: Krag rose to power through a combination of strength, cunning, and participation in dark rituals that set him apart from other goblins. His rock-biting habit is both a sign of his toughness and a mark of his ritualistic practices.
- **Ambitious**: Krag has aspirations beyond just leading a small band of goblins. He dreams of expanding his influence and carving out a goblin kingdom in the heart of Eldoria Forest.

#### Abilities and Equipment

- **Combat Skills**: Krag is proficient with a variety of weapons, favoring a jagged short sword and a spiked shield. He is also skilled in hand-to-hand combat.
- **Dark Magic**: He has some knowledge of dark goblin magic, allowing him to cast minor curses and hexes.
- **Tactical Mind**: Krag is a skilled tactician, often using the environment to his advantage in battle.

#### Notable Traits

- **Blood Rituals**: Krag's participation in blood rituals has made him more resilient and fearsome in combat. He gains a slight regenerative ability, healing minor wounds quickly.
- **Fear Aura**: His presence and reputation cause a slight fear in weaker creatures, making it harder for them to fight effectively.

#### Adventure Hook

- **Map to Goblin Lair**: Upon his defeat, Krag carries a map that outlines the path to the main Goblin Lair deeper in Eldoria Forest. This map is crudely drawn but contains enough detail to guide the players to their next adventure.
- **Intel on Goblin Plans**: Krag has a set of orders from a higher goblin authority, hinting at a larger plot that threatens not just North Lodge but potentially the entire region. This can provide a larger narrative hook for the campaign.
