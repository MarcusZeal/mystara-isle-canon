#### Background: Garos, the Green Dragonborn

Garos is a Green Dragonborn who has spent his life serving in the esteemed military of Eboncrest. Known for his formidable strength and unyielding dedication, Garos quickly rose through the ranks, earning respect from his peers and superiors alike. His scales, dark green with a sheen like polished jade, and his piercing yellow eyes made him a striking figure on the battlefield. With yellow fins and dark green scales, Garos stands nearly 7 feet tall. He's decked out in black chain mail and has all kinds of weapons strapped and buckled to his armor. On his back, he's carrying a Maul, a Greataxe, and a Greatsword—perfect for smashing, gutting, or slashing anything that gets in his way.

#### Mission to the North

Garos was recently assigned a critical mission to investigate and explore the northern territories surrounding Eldoria Forest. This region had become increasingly dangerous due to rising tensions and reports of hostile activity. Leading a small scouting party, Garos ventured north, determined to uncover the source of the disturbances and ensure the safety of Eboncrest.

However, as they traversed the dense woodlands, the party was ambushed by a group of hostile Wood Elves. These elves, guardians of their ancient territory, viewed all outsiders as threats. In the ensuing battle, Garos's party was overwhelmed. Despite his best efforts, Garos was separated from his comrades and forced to retreat. Wounded and exhausted, he pushed further north, desperately seeking safety.

#### Transformation: Luke Smith

Luke Smith, a Cyber Security professional from Earth, lived a vastly different life. Originally a rockstar athlete on track for a full football scholarship to Vanderbilt, Luke's dreams were shattered by a massive spinal injury at the tail end of his senior year. The injury not only ended his athletic career but also confined him to a wheelchair. Over the next ten years, Luke channeled his determination and resilience into mastering cybersecurity, eventually securing a position at the prestigious Bank of the United States.

One fateful evening, while working late at the bank, Luke experienced a strange and sudden phenomenon. A blinding flash of light enveloped him, and he felt himself being pulled away from his world. When he awoke, he found himself in a new body—Garos, the Green Dragonborn. The fusion of Luke's mind and Garos's body brought together Luke's tactical intellect and Garos's warrior instincts.

#### Arrival in Mystara Isle

Garos, now with the memories and consciousness of Luke Smith, found himself just north of Eldoria Forest, disoriented but alive. The landscape was unfamiliar, yet he felt a strange sense of purpose. He realized that the same presence that had pulled him from his world had also granted him a second chance—to walk, to fight, and to forge a new path.

As Garos adjusted to his new form, he encountered the village of North Lodge. Here, he met other adventurers who had similarly mysterious origins, each with their own unique abilities and backstories. With his newfound companions, Garos decided to investigate the threats facing Mystara Isle, starting with the goblin attacks in Eldoria Forest.

#### Traits and Equipment

Garos is a boulder of a Dragonborn, imposing and intimidating. His dark green scales provide natural camouflage in the forest, and his yellow fins add an exotic touch to his appearance. Garos's military training in Eboncrest has equipped him with a wide array of combat skills. His black chain mail is both functional and a symbol of his former rank. His arsenal includes a Maul, a Greataxe, and a Greatsword, each weapon carefully maintained and ready for use.

#### Motivations and Goals

While Garos retains his loyalty to Eboncrest and his mission to protect the realm, Luke's consciousness brings a new perspective. He is driven by a desire to understand the forces that brought him to Mystara Isle and to protect the people he encounters. The fusion of Garos and Luke creates a complex individual—part seasoned warrior, part modern-day tactician. Together, they aim to unravel the mysteries of Mystara Isle and forge a new destiny in this fantastical world.
