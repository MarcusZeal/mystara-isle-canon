#### Background: Life on Earth

Before his arrival in Mystara Isle, Thistle was an avid crafter and tinkerer on Earth. He had a natural talent for putting things together, whether it was assembling intricate models, fixing broken gadgets, or creating new inventions from spare parts. Crafting was more than a hobby; it was a way for him to express his creativity and ingenuity. His meticulous nature and problem-solving skills made him a sought-after handyman in his community.

#### Transformation: Arrival in Mystara Isle

One day, while working on a particularly challenging project, Thistle experienced a strange sensation. During a tragic accident, logs or something fell on him.

When he opened his eyes, he found himself in a completely different worldâ€”a world of magic and mystery.

Thistle soon realized he had been transformed into a Kenku, a small, bird-like humanoid known for their mimicry and dexterity. Unlike other Kenku who are typically bound by their race's limitations, Thistle discovered he had no prior memories or identity in this new body. It was as if the body had been waiting for his consciousness to inhabit it. This new form retained his keen mind and dexterous hands, albeit in a different shape.

#### Appearance

As a Kenku, Thistle stands about 4 feet tall, with sleek black feathers covering his body. His eyes are a sharp, intelligent amber, always observing and analyzing his surroundings. His beak, although unusual to him at first, has become an essential tool in his new life. Thistle wears simple, practical clothing, designed for ease of movement and filled with numerous pockets and pouches to carry his tools and creations.

#### Arrival in North Lodge

Thistle appeared in Mystara Isle near the outskirts of North Lodge. Disoriented but curious, he quickly made his way to the village, where he was met with a mix of curiosity and caution. Kenku were not common in North Lodge, but the villagers soon recognized Thistle's harmless nature and impressive crafting skills.

Thistle set up a small workshop in the village, using his talents to repair tools, create useful items, and assist with various projects. His ability to mimic sounds and voices fascinated the locals, and he often used this skill to entertain children or communicate more effectively with those around him.


#### Motivations and Goals

Thistle's primary motivation is to understand his new existence and make the best of his situation. While he misses his old life and the familiarity of his workshop on Earth, he sees Mystara Isle as an opportunity to explore new forms of crafting and invention. He is driven by a desire to learn and create, always seeking to improve his skills and help those around him.

Thistle also hopes to uncover the mystery of his transformation and arrival in this world. Unlike others who were transported with their bodies intact, Thistle's unique experience has left him with many questions. He is determined to find answers and, perhaps, discover a way to reconnect with his old world.

#### Relationships

Thistle quickly formed bonds with the villagers of North Lodge, especially those who appreciate his crafting skills. He often collaborates with Miri the Carpenter, sharing techniques and ideas. He has also become friends with Gareth the Blacksmith, assisting him with intricate metalwork and repairs.

Thistle's presence in the village has brought a new dynamic to the community, blending his Earthly ingenuity with the magical possibilities of Mystara Isle. As he embarks on adventures with other players, Thistle's unique perspective and abilities will undoubtedly play a crucial role in their journey.
