**Temporary Backstory for : Tem P. Rary**

Tem P. Rary found himself in the world of Mystara Isle roughly 50 years ago, mysteriously transformed into an elf. Stranded and bewildered, he was taken in by a compassionate group of elves who taught him the ways of the druid. Embracing his new life, Tem found solace and purpose in the natural world, quickly mastering the druidic arts and forming a deep connection with the land.

Unlike many others who might long for their old lives on Earth, Tem has no desire to return. He loves the freedom and adventure that Mystara Isle offers, feeling more at home in this magical realm than he ever did on Earth. His journey brought him close to Lila the Herbalist and her family, forming strong bonds of friendship and trust. Tem is the only member of the party aware that Lila and her family are elves, a secret he guards closely out of respect for their privacy.

Tem's empathetic nature extends to the misunderstood goblins, with whom he has also forged friendships. Seeing their plight and the misconceptions others have about them, Tem is reminded of his own journey of acceptance and belonging. His unique perspective has earned him the respect of many, including the goblin warchief Grubnar.

Recently, Grubnar sent Tem to explore the Eldoran Ruins in Eldoria Forest, seeking to uncover ancient secrets and potential threats. Tem embarked on this mission alone, guided by his druidic instincts and the wisdom imparted by his elven mentors. It is during this exploration that Tem encounters the other adventurers from Earth near the Spirit Riddle trial, recognizing a shared origin and fate that binds them together in their quest.
