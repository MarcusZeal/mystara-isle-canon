It started off like any other day. I packed up my gear, ready to get to work. I was a fisherman from Kodiak, Alaska, trying to make ends meet. With little time left until my next rent payment, I went out even though there was a storm warning. I was told not to go, but nothing would stop me. As I sailed further from the shore, I noticed the sky darkening. Still, I pressed on.

The waves grew stronger, crashing against my boat. I tried to keep the vessel steady, but the storm was too powerful. I lost control and was thrown into the sea.

I struggled to stay afloat for what felt like hours, but my strength was fading fast. The waves dragged me deeper into their cold, unrelenting grasp.

I pleaded with anyone or anything that might hear me. I wasn’t a religious person, but in that moment, I prayed. The waves pulled me under, and I thought it was all over. Maybe this is what I wanted. After all, I had a death wish going out on a day like this.

As I slowly accepted my fate and closed my eyes, I felt its presence. I don’t know exactly what it was, but it was truly powerful. The only word to describe it was god. With the last of my strength, I pleaded for it to save me, and then everything went dark.

I woke up the next day on a beach I didn’t recognize.

I walked around, looking for someone to tell me where I was. When I found a town, I realized I was somewhere completely unfamiliar. The people spoke the same language, but when I asked where I was, they all said, “You’re on Mystara Isle in the city of Dawnham.” Anytime I mentioned the United States, I got blank stares. I slowly came to realize the situation and went back to the beach to figure out what to do.

As I sat on the beach, dipping my feet in the water to clear my head, I felt the same presence again. A 10-foot-tall tentacle erupted from the water. I started to run, but it didn’t chase me. It almost looked like it was waiting for an order from me. I asked it to shake my hand, and it obliged. I felt as if I had the ability to control more than just the tentacle and wanted to learn more about this power.

I eventually settled in Dawnham, working for a fishing company by day and practicing magic at night. I found a magic tutor who told me my magic was similar but different to their own. They taught me the basics of cantrips and spells.

I kept my ability to summon the tentacle a secret. My tutor didn’t know of any spell that could conjure a tentacle like that. After about two months in this world, Dawnham was attacked by pirates. I tried to protect the people I cared about. My teacher was backed into a corner, and without thinking, I summoned the tentacle to save her.

When the battle ended, I was met with anger and hatred. The people shouted at me, calling me a disciple of Panzuriel, a god believed to lay waste to the seas and seek to flood the world. I went from a savior to a pariah in an instant.

As they attempted to take my life, I fled to Eldoria Forest to the north. I constantly questioned why Panzuriel would save me, a human. He despises humans and wants to lay waste to the world. I kept asking the tentacle if it was Panzuriel, but it seemed to deny it. I knew I had to keep going, hiding my true power and finding answers about who my true patron god is. I headed to North Lodge to begin my search for answers.
