#### Background

Elara was born and raised in the druidic community of Balgaran Woods. Her family and their small community revered nature and called upon its magic to accomplish great deeds. 

Many of the elders were druids, weaving their spells to protect and nurture the forest. 

Though Elara never had an interest in becoming a druid herself, she absorbed a deep passion for the elements from her family and the community around her.

In her 80s, driven by a desire to establish her own path and share her knowledge, Elara traveled to Eboncrest to start a business. She founded [[The Whispering Willow]], infusing it with the magic and wisdom of her upbringing. Her establishment quickly became a haven for travelers and locals alike, known for its enchanting atmosphere and exceptional hospitality.

Elara's sister, Lila, studied under her for 30 years, learning the art of herbalism and the ways of their family. Eventually, Lila moved to North Lodge to open her own shop, continuing the family tradition of healing and herbal magic. 

Despite the distance, the sisters remain close, regularly exchanging rare herbs and ingredients to support each other's work.
