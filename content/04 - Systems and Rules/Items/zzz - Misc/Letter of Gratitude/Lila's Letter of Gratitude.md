**Dear Sister,**

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to tell you about the remarkable adventurers who saved our village from a terrible threat. [[North Lodge]] faced an invasion of changelings, and without their bravery, we might not have survived.

These heroes stood as our defenders, their courage and unyielding resolve protecting our home and preserving the peace we hold so dear. Their deeds were nothing short of extraordinary.

I thought of you often during these dark times, and I wanted you to know about the ones who saved us. I believe you in [[Eboncrest]] would be delighted to hear of their valor and extend your hospitality to them.

With all my love and gratitude,

**Lila**
