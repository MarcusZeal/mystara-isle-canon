**Dear Brother,**

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to share the incredible story of a group of heroes who came to the aid of our village, [[North Lodge]], in a time of great peril. These adventurers faced down terrifying threats and saved our home from certain destruction.

Their bravery and dedication were truly inspiring, and I feel a deep sense of gratitude for their actions. I believe you in [[Dawnham]] would be delighted to hear of their exploits and perhaps extend your support to them in whatever way you can.

With love and thanks,

**Miri**
