**Captain Thorne,**

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. It’s been a while since we last spoke, and I wanted to share some news that you might find of interest. Recently, our peaceful village of [[North Lodge]] faced an unexpected and dangerous threat—an invasion of changelings.

In the midst of this crisis, a group of adventurers stepped up and defended our village with incredible bravery and skill. They fought off the changelings and saved countless lives. Their valor on the battlefield reminded me of the days when we served together, facing insurmountable odds and emerging victorious.

These heroes deserve recognition and support. Please admit them into [[The Adventurers' Guild]] and either wave the fee or send me the bill. It's the least I can do for these young heroes. 

With respect,
**Darius**

P.S. - Don't forget that you still owe me. If you wave the 100gp fee per person, I'll consider us square.
