**Type:** Wondrous Item (Amulet)

**Description:**
This amulet is crafted from a silver feather, delicately carved and adorned with small, shimmering gemstones that catch the light with an ethereal glow. It hangs on a fine chain, and the feather appears to pulse with a subtle, rhythmic light, as if echoing the beat of a heart.

**Properties:**
- **Curse Lifted:** While wearing this amulet, the Kenku is freed from their racial curse, allowing them to speak freely and use their original voice.
- **Psychic Resonance:** The amulet enhances the Rogue's Soulknife abilities. The Kenku gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with their Psychic Blades.
- **Enhanced Evasion:** The amulet grants the wearer advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that they can see, such as traps and spells.
- **Echo of the Past:** Once per long rest, the wearer can cast *Speak with Dead* without expending a spell slot. The target of the spell does not have to be a humanoid, allowing the wearer to commune with the echoes of any creature that once lived.

**Attunement:** Yes

**Lore:**
The Amulet of the Echoing Voice was created by a benevolent deity who took pity on the Kenku race and sought to provide a way for them to reclaim their voices. The amulet's power resonates with the soul of the wearer, enhancing their natural abilities and granting them new ones. It is a rare and precious item, often sought after by Kenku who long to break free from the curse that has silenced them for generations. The amulet's echoing light symbolizes the return of the wearer's voice, a beacon of hope and freedom.
