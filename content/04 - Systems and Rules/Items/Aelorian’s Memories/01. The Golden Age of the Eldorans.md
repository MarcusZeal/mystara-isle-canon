#### The Golden Age of the Eldorans


> "Long ago, in the dawn of time, the Eldorans emerged as the first great civilization of Eldrath. We were a proud and noble people, blessed with long lives and an insatiable thirst for knowledge. Our cities were marvels of architecture and magic, each a testament to our ingenuity and ambition. Eldoria, our capital, stood as a beacon of enlightenment and power, where the arts, sciences, and arcane studies flourished beyond imagination.
> 
> We Eldorans dedicated our lives to understanding the world around us. We mastered the elements, crafted wondrous artifacts, and forged alliances with the natural world. Our scholars and mages delved into the mysteries of the universe, uncovering secrets that allowed us to manipulate the very fabric of reality.
> 
> At the heart of our power were powerful glowing blue crystals that fueled our greatest achievements and technological marvels. In our pursuit of knowledge, we believed ourselves to be the stewards of Eldrath, destined to guide and protect its inhabitants.
> 
> For centuries, we prospered, living in harmony with nature and other races. Our wisdom was sought after, and our counsel was heeded by those who sought our guidance. Peace and prosperity reigned, and the world of Eldrath thrived under our stewardship."
