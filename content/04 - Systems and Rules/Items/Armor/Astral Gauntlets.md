**Type:** Wondrous Item (Gloves)

**Description:**
These ethereal gloves are woven from the fabric of the Astral Plane itself. They shimmer with a faint, otherworldly light and feel almost weightless to the touch. When worn, they adapt seamlessly to the wearer's hands, enhancing their connection to the Astral Plane.

**Properties:**
- **Enhanced Strikes:** While wearing these gauntlets, the monk's unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
- **Astral Empowerment:** The wearer gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with unarmed strikes and the arms of the astral self.
	- This becomes +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls at level 6. 
- **Phasing Strike:** Once per short rest, the wearer can make a special unarmed strike that phases partially through the Astral Plane. This strike allows the monk to bypass any nonmagical armor, shields, or natural defenses, effectively ignoring the target's AC for that attack.
- **Astral Pulse:** Once per long rest, the monk can release a burst of astral energy in a 30-foot radius centered on themselves. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes **6d4 force damage** and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't knocked prone.


**Attunement:** Yes

**Lore:**
The Astral Gauntlets were crafted by a legendary monk who journeyed through the Astral Plane, seeking to deepen their understanding of the universe. These gloves were created to bridge the gap between the physical and astral forms, allowing monks to channel the power of the Astral Plane more effectively in their combat and meditative practices. Each pair is unique, adapting to the spiritual essence of its wearer and amplifying their astral abilities.
