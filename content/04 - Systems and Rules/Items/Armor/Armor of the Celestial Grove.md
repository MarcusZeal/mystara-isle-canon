**Lore:**
This armor was created by the druids of an ancient wood elf clan who revered both the forest and the stars. It is said that the bark used in its creation was taken from trees blessed by celestial beings, granting the wearer a connection to both the earth and the heavens. The armor's silent nature helps the wearer move through the forest without disturbing the natural order, while the guiding light of the stars aids them in combat and navigation.
