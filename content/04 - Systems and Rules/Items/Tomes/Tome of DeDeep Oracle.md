**Type:** Wondrous Item (Book)

**Description:**
This ancient tome is bound in the hide of a sea serpent and inscribed with runes that glow with a deep, cerulean light. The pages are made from a unique, waterproof material that feels like a cross between vellum and kelp. It is adorned with small, embedded pearls and other marine jewels.

**Properties:**
- **Aquatic Adaptation:** The tome allows the wizard to cast *Water Breathing* and *Water Walk* once per day each without expending a spell slot.
- **Portent Enhancement:** When the wizard uses their Portent ability, they can choose to roll one of their Portent dice with advantage. This can be done once per long rest.
- **Oracle's Wisdom:** The tome grants the wizard proficiency in the Insight skill, and if they are already proficient, it grants expertise (double proficiency bonus).
- **Oceanic Aegis:** While holding the tome, the wizard has resistance to cold damage and advantage on saving throws against being frightened.
- **Tidal Wave:** Once per long rest, the wizard can use the tome to cast the *Tidal Wave* spell without expending a spell slot.

**Attunement:** Yes

**Lore:**
The Tome of the Deep Oracle was created by an ancient order of Triton seers who lived in the depths of the ocean. These scholars dedicated their lives to understanding the currents of fate and time, using their unique connection to the sea to enhance their divinatory powers. The tome is said to contain the wisdom of the ocean itself, offering guidance and clarity to those who can unlock its secrets. It is a prized possession among diviners and scholars, especially those with a deep connection to aquatic environments. The tome's power is further amplified when near the sea, encouraging its bearer to remain close to the source of its ancient magic.

This Tome came with **Conch Call** already written inside:

###### Conch Call

**3rd-level abjuration**

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a conch shell)

You sound the conch shell, waking sleepers and clearing thoughts of outside influence.

All sleeping creatures in range are awakened. This spell canâ€™t affect deafened creatures. This spell emits a clear horn note audible out to 300 feet.
