**Description:**
This ancient tome is bound in the hide of a sea serpent and inscribed with runes that glow with a deep, cerulean light. The pages are made from a unique, waterproof material that feels like a cross between vellum and kelp. It is adorned with small, embedded pearls and other marine jewels.

**Properties:**
- **Diviner's Insight:** While holding this tome, the wizard gains a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of their divination spells.
- **Aquatic Adaptation:** The tome allows the wizard to cast *Water Breathing* and *Water Walk* once per day each without expending a spell slot.
- **Deep Vision:** The tome enhances the wizard's ability to see into the future. Once per long rest, the wizard can cast *Divination* without expending a spell slot, and the answer received is more detailed than usual, providing extra clarity or additional information.
- **Oracle's Wisdom:** The tome grants the wizard proficiency in the Insight skill, and if they are already proficient, it grants expertise (double proficiency bonus).

**Attunement:** Yes

**Lore:**
The Tome of the Deep Oracle was created by an ancient order of Triton seers who lived in the depths of the ocean. These scholars dedicated their lives to understanding the currents of fate and time, using their unique connection to the sea to enhance their divinatory powers. The tome is said to contain the wisdom of the ocean itself, offering guidance and clarity to those who can unlock its secrets. It is a prized possession among diviners and scholars, especially those with a deep connection to aquatic environments.
