#### Personality

Aelorian is wise, compassionate, and deeply committed to preventing the same mistakes that led to the downfall of the Eldorans. He is patient and nurturing, often offering words of encouragement and wisdom. However, he can be stern when it comes to matters of great importance, especially those related to the Mistress and his dark ambitions.

#### Abilities and Features

##### 1. Knowledge of the Ancients

Aelorian can provide valuable information about Eldoran history, ancient magic, and the Mistress's plans. Once per long rest, the wearer can ask Aelorian a question about these topics. Aelorian will answer truthfully to the best of his knowledge.

##### 2. Protective Aura

Aelorian's Essence grants the wearer a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws. This bonus increases as the wearer levels up:

- Levels 1-9: +1 bonus
- Levels 10-14: +2 bonus
- Levels 15-17: +3 bonus
- Levels 18-20: +4 bonus

##### 3. Guiding Light

As an action, the wearer can activate Aelorian's Essence to emit a soft, radiant light in a 30-foot radius. This light dispels magical darkness and grants advantage on saving throws against fear and charm effects to all allies within the radius. The light lasts for 10 minutes and can be used once per long rest.

##### 4. Progressive Revelation

As the campaign progresses, Aelorian will reveal more about his past and the Mistress's plans. At key narrative points, he will share visions or memories that provide crucial information or context. This can include:

- **The Fall of the Eldorans**: Aelorian describes the events that led to the cataclysm and his own role in trying to prevent it.
- **The Mistress's Origin**: Insights into the Mistress's transformation and his motivations.
- **Ancient Rituals**: Knowledge of powerful rituals or spells that could aid the party in their quest.

##### 5. Aura of Threat

The wearer of Aelorian's Essence appears more threatening to enemies. Enemies within 30 feet of the wearer must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 6 + the wearer's proficiency bonus + the wearer's Charisma modifier) at the start of each of their turns. On a failed save, they are compelled to focus their attacks on the wearer, if possible.

This effect does not apply to creatures that cannot be charmed or those immune to fear.

---

#### Attunement

To attune to Aelorian's Essence, a character must spend a **long rest** meditating with the amulet, during which Aelorian will introduce himself and explain his purpose. Aelorian will only attune to a character who shares his commitment to stopping the Mistress and protecting the world of Eldrath.

Aelorian can be worn by any one member at any one time, but only a single member per session. 

Aelorian is assumed to be attuned to the entire party when it's been attuned to one. 

> **Mechanically speaking**, this way despite absences, this item is always able to be in use. 

---

#### Drawbacks

While Aelorian is generally supportive, he is deeply mistrustful of those who pursue power for its own sake. If the wearer engages in actions that Aelorian deems morally wrong or counterproductive to their shared goal, he may temporarily withdraw his support, causing the amulet to become inert until the wearer atones for their actions.
