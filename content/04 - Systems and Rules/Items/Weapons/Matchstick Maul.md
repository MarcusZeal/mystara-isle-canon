The Matchstick is no ordinary maul; it’s a testament to ingenuity and the bond between mentor and student. Crafted by Sarah, the protégé of North Lodge's revered blacksmith Gareth, the Matchstick's story begins with a spark of curiosity and a desire to create something extraordinary.

Sarah, having grown up watching Gareth's masterful work, developed a deep passion for blacksmithing. Gareth recognized her talent and took her under his wing, teaching her the intricacies of the craft. Even when Sarah moved to Eboncrest to refine her skills, she kept in constant contact with Gareth, sending letters filled with sketches and ideas.

One evening, inspiration struck Sarah as she watched the flickering flames of her forge. She envisioned a maul that could harness fire itself. The Matchstick was born—a powerful maul resembling a finger pointing. When scratched against a rugged surface, the extended finger would ignite, blazing with a magical fire.

Sarah poured her heart into this creation, combining her love for blacksmithing with a touch of arcane knowledge. After countless hours of forging and enchanting, the Matchstick was finally complete. It was her masterpiece, a symbol of her journey and the wisdom imparted by Gareth.

Sarah never would have been able to make it to this achievement without the help from Gareth and she was happy to depart with the Matchstick to the Heroes of North Lodge.
