**Type:** Weapon (Maul)

**Description:**
This menacing maul is forged from dark iron and constantly wreathed in flames. The head of the maul is shaped like an extended, skeletal index finger, with the flames emanating from the fingertip. The haft is wrapped in heat-resistant leather, allowing the wielder to handle it without harm.

**Properties:**
- **Magic Weapon:** You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
- **Flame Aura:** The maul is constantly on fire. It sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.
- **Fiery Strikes:** When you hit with an attack using this maul, the target takes an extra **1d6 fire damage**.
- **Blazing Finger:** Once per short rest, you can use an action to unleash a blast of fire from the maul's fingertip. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking **3d6 fire damage** on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
- **Heat Resistance:** While wielding this maul, you have resistance to fire damage.

**Attunement:** Yes

**Lore:**
The Inferno Maul was forged by a pyromancer blacksmith who infused it with the essence of elemental fire. The design, resembling an extended, fiery index finger, is said to represent the power to command flames and direct their wrath. The maul's constant flames and fiery strikes make it a fearsome weapon on the battlefield, capable of both lighting the way and scorching enemies.
