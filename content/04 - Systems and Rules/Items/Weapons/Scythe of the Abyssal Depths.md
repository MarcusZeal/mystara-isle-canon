**Description:**
This scythe is forged from an unknown, dark metal and imbued with the power of the deep ocean. Its blade is etched with glowing runes that pulse with an eerie, deep-sea blue light.

**Lore:**
The Scythe of the Abyssal Depths was gifted to a powerful Fathomless Warlock by an ancient sea deity. It is said to have been forged in the deepest trenches of the ocean, where the pressure and darkness are immense. The scythe's power comes from the abyss itself, channeling the cold and crushing force of the deep sea into the wielder's attacks and abilities. The enhancements to the warlock’s tentacles and the ability to empower allies reflect the depths' mysterious and fearsome nature, making it a symbol of the warlock's connection to the unfathomable abyss.
