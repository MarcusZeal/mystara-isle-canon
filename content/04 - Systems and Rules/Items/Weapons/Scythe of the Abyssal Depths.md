**Type:** Weapon (Scythe)

**Description:**
This scythe is forged from an unknown, dark metal and imbued with the power of the deep ocean. Its blade is etched with glowing runes that pulse with an eerie, deep-sea blue light. The haft is wrapped in kelp-like leather that seems to be always wet to the touch. The scytheâ€™s curved blade mimics the waves of the ocean, sleek and deadly.

**Properties:**
- **Weapon (Scythe):** +1 to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
- **Abyssal Grasp:** When the warlock hits a creature with this scythe, they can use a bonus action to attempt to grapple the target. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be grappled (escape DC 14). While grappled in this way, the creature takes 1d6 cold damage at the start of each of its turns.
- **Breath of the Deep:** The scythe grants the wielder the ability to breathe underwater and grants a swim speed equal to their walking speed.

**Attunement:** Yes

**Lore:**
The Scythe of the Abyssal Depths was gifted to a powerful Fathomless Warlock by an ancient sea deity. It is said to have been forged in the deepest trenches of the ocean, where the pressure and darkness are immense. The scythe's power comes from the abyss itself, channeling the cold and crushing force of the deep sea into the wielder's attacks and abilities. It is a symbol of the warlock's connection to the unfathomable depths and the mysteries that lie within.
