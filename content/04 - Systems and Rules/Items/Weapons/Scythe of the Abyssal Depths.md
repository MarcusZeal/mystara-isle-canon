**Type:** Weapon (Scythe)

**Description:**
This scythe is forged from an unknown, dark metal and imbued with the power of the deep ocean. Its blade is etched with glowing runes that pulse with an eerie, deep-sea blue light. The haft is wrapped in kelp-like leather that seems to be always wet to the touch. The scythe’s curved blade mimics the waves of the ocean, sleek and deadly.

- **Magic Weapon:** You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
- **Remove Curse** As an action, the warlock can use the scythe to cast the *Remove Curse* spell once per long rest.
- **Breath of the Deep:** The scythe grants the wielder the ability to breathe underwater and grants a swim speed equal to their walking speed.
- **Mystic Surge:** Once per long rest, the warlock can regain one expended spell slot of up to 3rd level.
- **Tentacle Empowerment:** The warlock’s tentacles, summoned through spells or abilities, deal an additional 1d8 damage and add the warlock's Charisma modifier to their damage rolls.


**Attunement:** Yes

**Lore:**
The Scythe of the Abyssal Depths was gifted to a powerful Fathomless Warlock by an ancient sea deity. It is said to have been forged in the deepest trenches of the ocean, where the pressure and darkness are immense. The scythe's power comes from the abyss itself, channeling the cold and crushing force of the deep sea into the wielder's attacks and abilities. The enhancements to the warlock’s tentacles and the ability to empower allies reflect the depths' mysterious and fearsome nature, making it a symbol of the warlock's connection to the unfathomable abyss.
