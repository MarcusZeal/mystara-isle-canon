**Type:** Weapon (Greatsword, two-handed)

**Description:** This immense greatsword is forged from a dark, corroded metal and adorned with oceanic motifs. The blade is etched with runes that glow with a faint, blue light, and the hilt is wrapped in weathered, salt-soaked leather. The crossguard resembles the fins of a mighty sea creature, and the blade itself seems to undulate like the waves.

**Properties:**

- **Magic Weapon:** You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
- **Wave Strike:** When you hit with an attack using this greatsword, you can choose to deal an additional 1d6 cold damage.
- **Storm Surge:** Once per short rest, you can use an action to unleash a wave of water in a 20-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be pushed 10 feet back. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and is not pushed.
- **Wild Magic Resonance:** While raging, the weapon’s runes pulse with energy, granting you more control over your Wild Magic Surge table. *Roll twice and choose the effect you prefer.*
- **Aquatic Adaptation:** The greatsword allows you to breathe underwater and grants a swim speed equal to your walking speed.

**Attunement:** Yes

**Lore:** Leviathan's Fury was said to be crafted by a pirate lord who struck a bargain with a powerful sea deity. This greatsword embodies the untamed fury of the ocean, enhancing the wild magic within its wielder. It is a symbol of the unrelenting power of the sea and the chaos it can bring. The weapon’s connection to water and wild magic makes it perfect for a Path of the Wild Magic Barbarian, particularly one who thrives in aquatic environments.
