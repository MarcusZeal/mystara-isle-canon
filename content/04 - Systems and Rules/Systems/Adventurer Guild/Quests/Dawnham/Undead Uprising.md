### Scene 1: Gathering Information

#### Setting the Scene

As you arrive in Dawnham, you notice the townsfolk are on edge, speaking in hushed tones about the undead sightings. You make your way to the Adventurers' Guild office to gather more information about the recent undead activities.

4. **Have there been any attacks?**

### Scene 2: Investigating the Graveyard

#### Setting the Scene

Following the information gathered, you make your way to the old graveyard on the outskirts of Dawnham. The graveyard is overgrown with weeds, and the tombstones are weathered and covered in moss. An eerie silence hangs in the air, broken only by the occasional rustle of leaves.

**What You Don't See**: The true source of the undead uprising is hidden within the graveyard, concealed by ancient magic.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **Are there any signs of recent activity?**
   - **Response**: A successful Investigation check (DC 13) reveals freshly disturbed graves and footprints leading to a mausoleum in the center of the graveyard.

2. **Is there a focal point for the undead activity?**
   - **Response**: A successful Perception check (DC 14) reveals a faint, dark aura emanating from the mausoleum, suggesting it is the source of the undead uprising.

3. **What kind of undead creatures might we face?**
   - **Response**: Based on the information gathered, expect a mix of skeletons, zombies, and possibly more powerful undead like wights or specters.

### Scene 3: The Mausoleum

#### Setting the Scene

After dealing with the undead in the graveyard, you follow the dark aura to the mausoleum in the center. The mausoleum is an imposing structure, its stone doors slightly ajar. Inside, the air is cold and damp, and you can feel the presence of dark magic.

**What You Don't See**: The mausoleum holds the key to stopping the undead uprising, but it is guarded by powerful creatures.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **What is inside the mausoleum?**
   - **Response**: A successful Investigation check (DC 14) reveals necromantic symbols and an altar dedicated to an unknown dark deity.

2. **How do we stop the undead uprising?**
   - **Response**: A successful Arcana check (DC 15) suggests disrupting the necromantic ritual by destroying the altar and the artifacts used in the ritual.

3. **Are there any traps or dangers inside?**
   - **Response**: A successful Perception check (DC 13) reveals ancient traps protecting the mausoleum, such as pressure plates and concealed spikes.

#### Final Encounter: Mausoleum Guardians

Inside the mausoleum, you confront the source of the undead uprising—a necromancer and their undead minions guarding the altar.

**Combat Encounter**:
- **Necromancer** (use Necromancer stats from the Monster Manual)
- **Wights** (use Wight stats from the Monster Manual) - 2 wights as backup.

**Tactics**: The necromancer uses powerful spells to control the battlefield, while the wights protect the altar and engage the adventurers in melee combat.

### Scene 4: Resolution

#### Setting the Scene

After defeating the necromancer and their minions, you destroy the altar and disrupt the necromantic ritual. The dark aura dissipates, and the graveyard begins to feel less oppressive.

**What You Don't See**: The true origins of the necromancer's power and the dark deity they served remain a mystery, leaving room for future investigations.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **What should we do with the necromancer's artifacts?**
   - **Response**: The artifacts should be brought back to the Adventurers' Guild for safekeeping and further study.

2. **What about the remaining undead?**
   - **Response**: Ensuring the remaining undead are eliminated or driven away will bring peace to the graveyard and the local community.

3. **Should we report this to the Adventurers' Guild?**
   - **Response**: Yes, reporting your success to the Adventurers' Guild will secure your reward and increase your standing within the guild.

#### Next Steps

**Secure the Graveyard**: Ensure no additional threats remain and gather any valuable information.

**Return to Dawnham**: Report your findings and success to the Adventurers' Guild to claim your reward.

**Investigate Further**: Optionally, the adventurers could choose to investigate the dark deity and the necromancer's connections to other potential threats.
