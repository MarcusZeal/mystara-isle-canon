After dealing with the minions, you enter the dragon's lair. The interior is vast and filled with treasures hoarded by the dragon. The air is thick with the smell of sulfur and the sound of the dragon's deep, rumbling breaths.

3. **Are there any weaknesses we can exploit?**
   - **Response**: A successful Arcana check (DC 16) reveals that dragons often have a weak spot near their underbelly, which is less protected than their back and sides.

#### Final Encounter: The Dragon



Inside the lair, you confront the dragon, a fearsome and intelligent creature. It demands to know why you have intruded into its domain and prepares for battle.

**Combat Encounter**:
- **Dragon** (use Adult Dragon stats from the Monster Manual, appropriate for the party's level)
