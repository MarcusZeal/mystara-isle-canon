![[Eboncrest AG Office#"Haunted House"]]



#### Setting the Scene

**Starting Point**: The adventurers begin at the Adventurers' Guild in Eboncrest, where they receive the quest details and a brief description of the haunted house and its history.

**Western District Description**: The western district of Eboncrest is an older part of the city, with narrow cobblestone streets and buildings that show their age. The abandoned house stands out, with its boarded-up windows and overgrown garden, emanating an aura of neglect and unease.

### Scene 1: Arriving at the Haunted House

#### Setting the Scene

As you step into the western district, the atmosphere grows noticeably quieter. The usual bustle of city life fades, replaced by an eerie stillness. The abandoned house looms ahead, its once-grand facade now covered in grime and overgrown vines. The windows are boarded up, and the front door hangs slightly ajar, creaking in the wind.

**What You Don't See**: Despite the quiet, you can't shake the feeling that you're being watched. Shadows seem to flicker in the corners of your vision, but when you turn to look, there's nothing there.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **What is the history of this house?**
   - **Response**: The house was once owned by a wealthy merchant family, the Halwicks, who mysteriously disappeared several years ago. Since then, no one has dared to live there.

2. **Have there been any recent sightings or occurrences?**
   - **Response**: Nearby residents report hearing strange noises at night, seeing ghostly figures in the windows, and feeling a cold, unnatural chill when passing by.

3. **Are there any known entrances besides the front door?**
   - **Response**: There is a side door that leads to a cellar, which might provide another way in.

#### Investigation and Clues

**Perception Check (DC 12)**:
- Success: You notice faint footprints leading to the side door, suggesting recent activity.
- Failure: The front of the house seems undisturbed, with no clear signs of recent entry.

**Investigation Check (DC 14)**:
- Success: You find a loose board on one of the windows that can be pried open to gain entry without using the doors.
- Failure: The house appears securely boarded up from the outside, with no obvious way in.

Haunted Cellar:

#### Setting the Scene

As you step inside the abandoned house, the temperature drops noticeably. The air is thick with dust, and the floorboards creak ominously under your feet. Faded portraits of the Halwick family hang crookedly on the walls, and cobwebs fill the corners of the rooms. Faint whispers seem to echo through the halls, adding to the unsettling atmosphere.

**What You Don't See**: The whispers grow louder in certain areas, hinting at the presence of something unseen and possibly supernatural.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **What are the whispers saying?**
   - **Response**: The whispers are faint and indistinct, but you catch fragments of words like "leave," "danger," and "help."

2. **Are there any signs of recent activity inside?**
   - **Response**: A successful Investigation check (DC 13) reveals footprints in the dust and recently disturbed furniture.

3. **Where should we search first?**
   - **Response**: The ground floor contains the main hall, a sitting room, and a kitchen. The second floor has bedrooms and a study, while the cellar might hold more secrets.

#### Investigation and Clues

**Perception Check (DC 13)**:
- Success: You notice a faint, ghostly light emanating from the cellar door.
- Failure: The interior seems dark and quiet, with no immediate signs of activity.

**Arcana Check (DC 14)**:
- Success: You sense a lingering magical presence, particularly strong near the cellar door.
- Failure: The house feels eerie, but you can't pinpoint any specific magical sources.

### Scene 3: The Cellar Confrontation

#### Setting the Scene

Descending into the cellar, you find yourself in a damp, cold space filled with old crates and broken furniture. The ghostly light is stronger here, casting eerie shadows on the walls. At the far end of the cellar, you see the source of the light: a spectral figure, glowing faintly, surrounded by swirling mist.

**What You Don't See**: The figure seems to be performing some sort of ritual, its movements slow and deliberate. The air is thick with the scent of decay.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **Who is the spectral figure?**
   - **Response**: The figure is the ghost of Evelyn Halwick, the last member of the Halwick family. She is trapped in the cellar, unable to move on due to unfinished business.

2. **What is the ghost doing?**
   - **Response**: Evelyn is attempting to complete a protective ritual that was interrupted by the family's untimely demise. The ritual is intended to protect the house from dark forces.

3. **How can we help her?**
   - **Response**: To help Evelyn, you must find and place three missing ritual items around the cellar: a silver locket, a ceremonial dagger, and a book of family spells.

#### Encounter: The Haunting

**Combat Encounter**:
- **Poltergeists** (use Poltergeist stats from the Monster Manual) - Two poltergeists appear to protect Evelyn and the house from intruders.

**Tactics**: The poltergeists will use their Telekinetic Thrust to hurl objects at the adventurers and their Invisibility to move unseen.

#### Resolving the Haunting

After defeating the poltergeists and helping Evelyn complete the ritual, the ghostly figure of Evelyn will speak to the adventurers.

**Evelyn's Dialogue**:
- "Thank you for helping me. I can finally rest in peace. Take this locket as a token of my gratitude. Use it to protect those in need."

#### Resolution

The adventurers find the missing ritual items scattered around the cellar. Once placed correctly, Evelyn completes the ritual and vanishes, leaving behind a silver locket imbued with protective magic.

**Paths Forward**:
- **Return to the Guild**: The adventurers can return to the Adventurers' Guild to report their success and claim their reward.
- **Explore Further**: The adventurers might choose to explore the house further for any hidden secrets or treasures.

#### Quest Completion

Upon successful completion, the adventurers receive 60 Gold and 10 Guild Points. They also gain a positive reputation within the guild, opening up more challenging and rewarding quests in the future. The silver locket can be used as a minor magical item that offers a small protective enchantment (e.g., +1 to AC for one encounter per day).
