![[Eboncrest AG Office#"Wolf Attacks"]]


#### Setting the Scene

**Starting Point**: The adventurers begin at the Adventurers' Guild in Eboncrest, where they receive the quest details and a basic map showing the location of the affected farms.

**Farms Description**: The affected farms are located on the outskirts of Eboncrest. The landscape is dotted with fields, barns, and grazing livestock. Farmers and their families can be seen working hard to maintain their livelihoods despite the recent troubles.

### Scene 1: Arriving at the Farms

#### Setting the Scene

As you approach the farms, you can see the toll the wolf attacks have taken. Livestock pens are damaged, and a few carcasses of animals lie abandoned, showing signs of brutal attacks. The farmers look weary and worried, casting anxious glances toward the nearby woods.

**What You Don't See**: Despite the obvious signs of attacks, the wolves themselves are nowhere in sight, creating an unsettling tension.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **What exactly happened during the attacks?**
   - **Response**: "The wolves come at night, attacking our livestock and sometimes even our dogs. They're vicious and seem more coordinated than usual."

2. **Have you noticed anything unusual about the wolves?**
   - **Response**: "They're bigger than normal wolves, and their eyes... they glow with a strange light."

3. **Where do the wolves come from?**
   - **Response**: "They always seem to come from the eastern woods. We've tried to track them, but it's too dangerous to go far."

#### Investigation and Clues

**Perception Check (DC 12)**:
- Success: You notice large wolf tracks leading towards the eastern woods, with signs of recent activity.
- Failure: The tracks are difficult to follow, blending in with the general farm activity.

**Survival Check (DC 14)**:
- Success: You can clearly follow the trail of the wolves, noting that they travel in a pack and seem to have a specific lair they return to.
- Failure: The trail is confusing, and you might lose it if not careful.

### Scene 2: Tracking the Wolves

#### Setting the Scene

Following the tracks, you venture into the eastern woods. The forest is dense and dark, with a thick canopy overhead blocking much of the sunlight. The sounds of birds and rustling leaves fill the air, but there's an underlying sense of danger.

**What You Don't See**: Despite the seemingly peaceful surroundings, the presence of the wolves feels imminent, as if they are watching you from the shadows.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **How far into the woods do the tracks go?**
   - **Response**: The tracks lead deeper into the forest, indicating the wolves' lair is well-hidden and protected.

2. **Are there any signs of other creatures?**
   - **Response**: Aside from the wolf tracks, you notice occasional signs of deer and smaller forest animals, but nothing else threatening.

3. **Is there any indication of what might be driving the wolves?**
   - **Response**: A successful Nature check (DC 13) suggests that something might be influencing the wolves' behavior, making them more aggressive and organized.

#### Encounter: Wolf Pack

As you venture deeper, you hear the growls and see the glint of eyes in the underbrush. The wolf pack has noticed you and prepares to defend their territory.

**Combat Encounter**:
- **Wolves** (use Wolf stats from the Monster Manual) - 6 wolves initially, with a chance of reinforcement if the fight goes on too long.

**Tactics**: The wolves will use pack tactics to flank and overwhelm the adventurers, aiming to isolate and bring down individual targets.

### Scene 3: The Wolves' Lair

#### Setting the Scene

After dealing with the initial pack, you follow the remaining tracks to a cave entrance, partially hidden by overgrown vegetation. The cave seems to go deep into the earth, with an ominous, almost unnatural air about it.

**What You Don't See**: The interior of the cave is shrouded in darkness, and the sounds of growling echo faintly from within.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **Is this the wolves' main lair?**
   - **Response**: The cave appears to be the main den, judging by the number of tracks and the strong scent of wolves.

2. **Are there any signs of what might be influencing the wolves?**
   - **Response**: A successful Investigation check (DC 14) inside the cave reveals remnants of strange herbs and markings on the walls, suggesting the involvement of an external force or a druid.

3. **How many wolves are inside?**
   - **Response**: You hear the growls of several wolves, indicating that the den is well-occupied and defended.

#### Final Encounter: Alpha Wolf

Inside the cave, you confront the alpha wolf, larger and more menacing than the others. It stands protectively over a makeshift altar with strange symbols and herbs scattered around.

**Combat Encounter**:
- **Alpha Wolf** (use Dire Wolf stats from the Monster Manual, with increased HP and damage)
- **Remaining Wolves** (use Wolf stats from the Monster Manual) - 4 wolves as backup.

**Tactics**: The alpha wolf fights fiercely to protect its den and the strange altar. The other wolves will support it, using pack tactics to their advantage.

### Scene 4: Resolution

#### Setting the Scene

After defeating the wolves and inspecting the altar, you find clues pointing to a druid or a magical influence that has been driving the wolves to attack the farms.

**What You Don't See**: The presence of the strange herbs and symbols suggests that this is not a natural occurrence.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **What do the symbols and herbs mean?**
   - **Response**: A successful Arcana check (DC 15) reveals that the herbs and symbols are used in druidic rituals, possibly to control or influence animals.

2. **What should we do with the altar?**
   - **Response**: Destroying the altar might break the influence over any remaining wolves in the area.

3. **Should we report this to someone?**
   - **Response**: Yes, reporting the findings to the Adventurers' Guild will help them understand the situation better and take necessary actions.

#### Next Steps

**Destroy the Altar**: Breaking the altar's influence could stop any further attacks.

**Return to the Guild**: Report your findings and actions taken to the Adventurers' Guild to claim your reward.

**Investigate Further**: Optionally, the adventurers could choose to investigate who or what created the altar and why, leading to further quests.

#### Quest Completion

Upon successful completion, the adventurers receive 50 Gold and 10 Guild Points. They also gain a reputation for handling dangerous wildlife and uncovering hidden threats, opening up more challenging and rewarding quests in the future.
