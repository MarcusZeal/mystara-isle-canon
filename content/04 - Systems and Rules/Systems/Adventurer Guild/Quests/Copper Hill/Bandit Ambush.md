### Scene 1: Gathering Information

   - **Response**: "The bandits came out of nowhere, blocking the road and attacking us from both sides. They took everything and left us with nothing."

2. **Can you describe the bandits?**

3. **Do you have any idea where they might be hiding?**
   - **Response**: "We've heard rumors of a camp deep in the forest, near the old abandoned mill. It's a perfect spot for hiding and launching surprise attacks."

#### Investigation and Clues

**Perception Check (DC 12)**:
- Success: You notice tracks and signs of recent activity leading into the forest, suggesting a well-trodden path to the bandit camp.

### Scene 2: Tracking the Bandits

#### Setting the Scene

Following the clues gathered from the survivors, you venture into the dense forest. The path becomes increasingly narrow and overgrown, with the sounds of wildlife surrounding you. The deeper you go, the more signs of human activity you notice.

**What You Don't See**: Hidden traps and sentries placed by the bandits to alert them of intruders.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **Are there any signs of the bandits nearby?**
   - **Response**: A successful Perception check (DC 13) reveals hidden tripwires and subtle markers indicating the presence of bandit sentries.

2. **How far into the forest is the camp?**
   - **Response**: "The camp is about an hour's walk from here, near the old mill. Be cautious; they have lookouts and traps set up to protect their hideout."

3. **Can we avoid the traps?**
   - **Response**: A successful Investigation check (DC 15) allows you to identify and disable the traps without alerting the bandits.

#### Encounter: Bandit Sentries

As you move closer to the camp, you encounter a small group of bandit sentries patrolling the area.

**Combat Encounter**:
- **Bandit Sentries** (use Bandit stats from the Monster Manual) - 3 bandits initially, with 2 more joining if the alarm is raised.

**Tactics**: The sentries will try to alert the main camp if they detect you, using the terrain to their advantage for ambushes.

### Scene 3: The Bandit Camp

#### Setting the Scene

After dealing with the sentries, you find the bandit camp hidden in a clearing near the old abandoned mill. The camp is fortified with makeshift barricades and lookout towers. Fires burn in the center, and you can see bandits preparing for their next raid.

**What You Don't See**: The bandit leader is holding a strategy meeting in his tent, unaware of your approach.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **How can we approach the camp unnoticed?**
   - **Response**: A successful Stealth check (DC 15) allows you to approach the camp unnoticed, finding a weak point in their defenses.

2. **Are there any leaders we should target?**
   - **Response**: A successful Investigation check (DC 14) reveals the bandit leader's tent, heavily guarded and positioned in the center of the camp.

3. **Can we create a distraction?**
   - **Response**: Yes, creating a distraction, such as setting a fire or causing a commotion, can draw some bandits away from their posts, making it easier to infiltrate the camp.

#### Final Encounter: Bandit Leader

Inside the camp, you confront the bandit leader, a tall, scarred man with a menacing presence. He commands a group of loyal bandits who will fight to protect him and the camp.

**Combat Encounter**:
- **Bandit Leader** (use Bandit Captain stats from the Monster Manual)
- **Bandits** (use Bandit stats from the Monster Manual) - 6 bandits as backup.

**Tactics**: The bandit leader fights fiercely, using his bandits to create a defensive perimeter. He will try to exploit any weaknesses in the adventurers' formation.

### Scene 4: Resolution

#### Setting the Scene

After defeating the bandit leader and his followers, you search the camp for any remaining threats and gather evidence of their raids. You find stolen goods, maps of their planned attacks, and personal belongings of the caravan victims.

**What You Don't See**: The camp is now in disarray, with the remaining bandits either fleeing or surrendering.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **What should we do with the captured bandits?**
   - **Response**: Captured bandits can be turned over to the local authorities in Eboncrest for justice and to send a message to other would-be criminals.

2. **What about the stolen goods?**
   - **Response**: Returning the stolen goods to the caravan survivors will help them recover from the attacks and bolster your reputation as honorable adventurers.

3. **Should we report this to the Adventurers' Guild?**
   - **Response**: Yes, reporting your success to the Adventurers' Guild will secure your reward and increase your standing within the guild.

#### Next Steps

**Secure the Camp**: Ensure no bandits remain and secure any valuable information.

**Return to the Guild**: Report your findings and success to the Adventurers' Guild to claim your reward.

**Investigate Further**: Optionally, the adventurers could choose to investigate the bandits' connections and whether there are other camps in the area.

#### Quest Completion

Upon successful completion, the adventurers receive 250 Gold and 1 Uncommon Rarity Weapon. They also gain a reputation for dealing with dangerous bandits and protecting trade routes, opening up more challenging and rewarding quests in the future.
