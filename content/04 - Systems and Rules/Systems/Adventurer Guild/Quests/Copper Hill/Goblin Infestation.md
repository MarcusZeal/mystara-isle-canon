### Scene 1: Gathering Information

#### Setting the Scene

As you arrive at Copper Hill, you make your way to the local tavern where residents have gathered to discuss the recent goblin troubles. The atmosphere is tense, with villagers exchanging worried glances and recounting their encounters with the goblins.

**What You Don't See**: Hidden among the crowd, a few goblins in disguise are listening in, gathering information on the villagers' plans.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **What kind of trouble have the goblins been causing?**
   - **Response**: "They've been stealing our supplies, harassing anyone who ventures too close to the forest, and causing all sorts of mischief."

2. **Can you describe the goblins?**
   - **Response**: "They're small, green-skinned, and quick. They usually come at night, making it hard to catch them."

3. **Do you know where they're hiding?**
   - **Response**: "We think they're camped out in the old ruins to the east. It's the perfect place for them to hide and plan their raids."

#### Investigation and Clues

**Perception Check (DC 12)**:
- Success: You notice tracks and signs of recent goblin activity leading towards the old ruins.
- Failure: The chaotic scene makes it difficult to gather clear information.

**Survival Check (DC 14)**:
- Success: You find a trail of small footprints and broken branches leading towards the ruins, indicating the goblins' frequent comings and goings.
- Failure: The trail is obscured by recent rain, making it hard to follow.

### Scene 2: Tracking the Goblins

#### Setting the Scene

Following the clues gathered from the villagers, you venture towards the old ruins to the east. The path becomes increasingly overgrown, with the sounds of the forest surrounding you. The deeper you go, the more signs of goblin activity you notice.

**What You Don't See**: Despite the signs of activity, the goblins themselves remain hidden, using the terrain to their advantage.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **Are there any signs of the goblins nearby?**
   - **Response**: A successful Perception check (DC 13) reveals hidden snares and tripwires set by the goblins to alert them of intruders.

2. **How far into the forest are the ruins?**
   - **Response**: "The ruins are about an hour's walk from here, hidden deep within the forest. Be cautious; the goblins are clever and have set traps to protect their hideout."

3. **Can we avoid the traps?**
   - **Response**: A successful Investigation check (DC 15) allows you to identify and disable the traps without alerting the goblins.

#### Encounter: Goblin Sentries

As you move closer to the ruins, you encounter a small group of goblin sentries patrolling the area.

**Combat Encounter**:
- **Goblin Sentries** (use Goblin stats from the Monster Manual) - 4 goblins initially, with 2 more joining if the alarm is raised.

**Tactics**: The goblins will try to alert the main camp if they detect you, using the terrain to their advantage for ambushes.

### Scene 3: The Goblin Camp

#### Setting the Scene

After dealing with the sentries, you find the entrance to the goblin camp nestled within the old ruins. The camp is fortified with makeshift barricades and lookout posts. Fires burn in the center, and you can see goblins milling about, preparing for their next raid.

**What You Don't See**: The camp appears deceptively quiet, with most of the goblins likely inside their makeshift tents or on guard duty.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **How can we approach the camp unnoticed?**
   - **Response**: A successful Stealth check (DC 15) allows you to approach the camp unnoticed, finding a weak point in their defenses.

2. **Are there any leaders we should target?**
   - **Response**: A successful Investigation check (DC 14) reveals the goblin leader's tent, heavily guarded and positioned in the center of the camp.

3. **Can we create a distraction?**
   - **Response**: Yes, creating a distraction, such as setting a fire or causing a commotion, can draw some goblins away from their posts, making it easier to infiltrate the camp.

#### Encounter: Goblin Leader (Shapeshifter)

Inside the camp, you confront the goblin leader, who is actually a shapeshifter manipulating the goblins for his own ends. The shapeshifter commands a group of loyal goblins who will fight to protect their home.

**Combat Encounter**:
- **Goblin Leader** (use Doppelganger stats from the Monster Manual)
- **Goblins** (use Goblin stats from the Monster Manual) - 6 goblins as backup.

**Tactics**: The goblin leader fights smart, using his goblins to create a defensive perimeter. He will try to exploit any weaknesses in the adventurers' formation.

#### The Revelation

As the fight progresses, the goblin leader reveals his true form, causing confusion and fear among the goblins.

**Goblin Reaction**:
- **Goblin 1**: "He's not goblin! He's a deceiver!"
- **Goblin 2**: "This is not goblin! We've been tricked!"

Some goblins may turn on the shapeshifter, realizing they've been manipulated.

### Scene 4: Resolution

#### Setting the Scene

After defeating the goblin leader and his followers, you search the camp for any remaining threats and gather evidence of their raids. You find stolen goods, maps of their planned attacks, and personal belongings of the villagers.

**What You Don't See**: The camp is now in disarray, with the remaining goblins either fleeing or surrendering.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **What should we do with the captured goblins?**
   - **Response**: Captured goblins can be turned over to the local authorities in Copper Hill for justice and to send a message to other would-be troublemakers.

2. **What about the stolen goods?**
   - **Response**: Returning the stolen goods to the villagers will help them recover from the attacks and bolster your reputation as honorable adventurers.

3. **Should we report this to the Adventurers' Guild?**
   - **Response**: Yes, reporting your success to the Adventurers' Guild will secure your reward and increase your standing within the guild.

#### Next Steps

**Secure the Camp**: Ensure no goblins remain and secure any valuable information.

**Return to the Guild**: Report your findings and success to the Adventurers' Guild to claim your reward.

**Investigate Further**: Optionally, the adventurers could choose to investigate the goblins' connections and whether there are other camps in the area.

#### Quest Completion

Upon successful completion, the adventurers receive 250 Gold. They also gain a reputation for dealing with goblin infestations and protecting the outskirts of Copper Hill, opening up more challenging and rewarding quests in the future.
