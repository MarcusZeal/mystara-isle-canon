Religious beliefs in Vodari flow like the tides – some violent and destructive, smoking with sacrifice, and some sunkissed and gentle, warm with the touch of joined hands.

While clerics and paladins often choose to revere a specific deity, many inhabitants of Vodari pray based on their circumstances. Vodarians pray to Tero for good health, to Fortana for luck in a game of chance, to Aerako for favorable winds, or to Mirta for safe passage into the afterlife. The people balance their worship by building shrines and temples to benevolent gods such as Toamna and Tero, and making sacrifices to appease destructive deities like Volkan. Temples, and the priests who run them, provide blessings, celebrations, and ceremonies of all kinds, and even sanctuary to those who need safe harbor.

Even with the circumstantial nature of prayer in Vodari, Vodarians will often find themselves praying to one or two gods more often than others, and in those cases, a relationship begins to build, a closeness forms and worship becomes less occasional, more personal.

Each god has a preferred avatar, and some say that the avatars indicate a preference, a chosen people or profession of Vodarians who are most beloved. Dragonborn, for example, have a long history of worshiping Volkan who often appears as one of their own, or in the form of a fire-breathing red dragon. Halfling farmers consider themselves beloved of Toamna, while halfling adventurers often declare themselves chosen of Fortana.

There are many living Vodarians who have seen the gods (or at least their avatars). For those who have not seen a god with their own eyes or heard a first- or second-hand account from someone who has, Vesi’s Rage itself is present in their world, a tempest that roils with divine energies beyond the normal features of nature. For most, the prevailing opinion is that the gods are real, but there are dissenters and even the odd atheist philosophers (though even they are blessed by Istoro, who grins behind his hand when he favors them).
