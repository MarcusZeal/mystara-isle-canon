**Goddess of the Moon, Night, and the Hunt**

Lupara, revered as the Moon Huntress, once illuminated the night sky with her silver glow, guiding hunters and wanderers alike through the darkness. Her domain encompassed the moon, night, and the hunt. She was a fierce protector of nocturnal creatures and those who ventured into the wilderness under the cover of night.

#### Appearance and Symbolism

Lupara often appeared as a tall, lithe figure cloaked in shimmering moonlight, with eyes that glowed like the full moon. Her bow, crafted from lunar silver, was said to never miss its mark. Accompanied by a pack of spectral wolves, she roamed the night, ensuring the balance between predator and prey was maintained. Her presence brought a sense of calm and clarity, her light cutting through the deepest darkness.

#### Silence of Centuries

For centuries, Lupara has been silent. Her once vibrant presence is now a mere whisper in the wind. Legends speak of a great sorrow that befell her, causing her to withdraw from the world of mortals and even the divine. The moon still shines, but without the guiding touch of Lupara, its light feels distant and cold. Hunters and nocturnal creatures sense her absence, and the nights seem longer and more perilous without her watchful gaze.

#### Legacy and Worship

Despite her silence, Lupara's influence lingers. Hunters still whisper prayers to her before a night hunt, and lost travelers look to the moon for guidance, hoping to catch a glimpse of her spectral wolves. Temples and shrines dedicated to Lupara can be found in secluded forests and mountain tops, where devotees leave offerings of silver and moonstone, praying for her return.

**Followers of Lupara are expected to:**

- Respect the balance of nature, particularly during the night.
- Protect nocturnal creatures and honor the cycles of the moon.
- Seek clarity and guidance in the moonlight, embracing the mysteries of the night.

**Legends and Myths:** Many stories are told about Lupara's departure. Some say she mourns the loss of a great love, others believe she retreated to prevent a cataclysmic event tied to the moon's power. There are those who quest to find her, believing that if she can be persuaded to return, the nights will once again be filled with her protective presence.

Lupara's legacy endures, a testament to her once vital role in the balance of the night and the hunt. Her silence is a mystery, but her impact on Vodari remains undeniable.
