The Destroyers embody chaos, destruction, and darkness. They oppose the order established by the Creators and often seek to bring about ruin and discord in Vodari.

**Dokahi - Goddess of the Deep Sea, Epic Poetry, and Monsters** [[Dokahi]], residing in the Benthic Deep, appears as a centaurian kraken. She nurtures monsters and outcasts, feeding on despair and reveling in epic tragedies. Her followers, often outcasts themselves, are expected to obey her without question, create tales of tragedy, and bring other outcasts into her fold.

**Morto - God of Necromancy and Secrets** [[Morto]], a giant serpent, delights in raising the dead and spreading decay. Once a guide of souls, he now thwarts his sister Mirta's work, raising undead armies. His followers seek to unearth secrets, use necromancy, and spread decay to unravel the world's tapestry. Morto's hatred for Mirta drives his campaign of darkness.

**Scatho - God of Conquest and Tyranny** [[Scatho]], a former Varuva soldier, now serves Vesi as a god of conquest. Appearing as a strong human or orc, he believes in ruling with strength and taking power by force. His followers are commanded to conquer the weak, rule mercilessly, and pursue power and glory without obstruction.

**Vesi - Goddess of Chaos, Storms, and Darkness** [[Vesi]], a dark elf, embodies chaos and freedom from order. She values her own free will above all and sows lies and discord to bring about rebellion and disorder. Her followers work to destroy institutions of order, spread chaos, and pursue absolute freedom. Vesi's presence is felt in the storms and chaos she brings to Vodari.

**Volkan - God of Fire and Destruction** [[Volkan]], a fiery dragonborn, emerged from his egg in a rage, creating the continent of Varanu. He values destruction and rebirth through fire, often hunting in dragon form. His followers, particularly dragonborn, conduct ritual sacrifices to appease him and are expected to unleash their fury to destroy their enemies completely. Volkan's eruptions symbolize the cycle of destruction and renewal.
