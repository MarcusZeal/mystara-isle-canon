Tritons are tall and lithe, standing between 5 and 6 feet tall. Their skin ranges in shades of blue and green, often with a slight iridescence that shimmers in the light. They have webbed hands and feet, gill slits on their necks, and fin-like protrusions on their forearms, calves, and backs. Tritons have hair that resembles seaweed, varying in color from deep blues to vibrant greens, and their eyes are large and reflective, similar to those of sea creatures.
