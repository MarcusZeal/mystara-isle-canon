#### Background

Lila was born in the druidic community of [[Balgaran Woods]], where her family and the elders called upon nature's magic to perform great deeds. Growing up in this environment, Lila developed a deep appreciation for the natural world and its healing properties. While she never pursued the path of a druid like many in her community, she was inspired by their connection to the elements and their ability to harness nature's power.

When Lila was in her 70s, she traveled to [[Eboncrest]] to study under her elder sister, Elara. For many years, Lila apprenticed at The Whispering Willow, learning the intricacies of herbalism and honing her skills. Elara's guidance and mentorship were instrumental in shaping Lila into the skilled herbalist she is today. Under her sister's tutelage, Lila gained a deep understanding of herbs, potions, and natural remedies, as well as the wisdom to use them effectively.

After almost a decade of study, Lila decided to strike out on her own and bring her knowledge to a new community. She moved to [[North Lodge]], where she established her own herbalist shop. Her gentle nature and expertise quickly earned her the trust and admiration of the villagers. 

Lila's shop became a sanctuary for those seeking healing and guidance, and her reputation as a skilled herbalist spread throughout the region.
