### Physical Appearance

- **Wrinkled Skin:** Elder Thorne's skin is deeply wrinkled, like the bark of an ancient tree. His complexion is a warm, earthy brown, with creases that map the many centuries he has lived. Each wrinkle seems to tell a story of time spent in the elements, weathered by the sun, wind, and rain.

- **White, Wispy Hair:** His hair is long and silver-white, flowing down his back like strands of moonlight. It is thin and wispy, moving gently in the breeze, almost as if it's part of the natural surroundings. Despite its ethereal quality, it retains a certain dignity, framing his face in a halo of light.

- **Piercing Eyes:** Elder Thorne's eyes are perhaps the most striking feature. They are a vivid green, the color of new leaves in spring, still sharp and clear despite his advanced age. His gaze is penetrating, as if he can see into the hearts of those who stand before him, yet there's a softness there too—a reflection of the wisdom and compassion he has cultivated over the centuries.

- **Leaning Posture:** His posture is slightly stooped, as though the weight of the years has bowed him down. He leans lightly on a staff made of gnarled wood, entwined with vines and small, blooming flowers. This staff is more than just a walking aid; it seems to pulse with a quiet, natural energy, symbolizing his connection to the druidic forces he commands.

### Attire
- **Simple, Natural Robes:** Elder Thorne wears robes of simple, undyed linen, the fabric rough and homespun. The robes are adorned with living vines that weave through the fabric, small flowers blooming here and there. These garments are practical, made for someone who spends their days in the forest, yet they carry an understated elegance that befits his status as a druidic leader.

- **Nature-Inspired Accessories:** Around his neck, Elder Thorne wears a necklace of polished stones and carved wooden beads, each one representing a different aspect of nature—the earth, the sky, the sea. A small Lunashard, dull and inert, is tucked away within the folds of his robe, a relic of his family's past that he keeps close, but hidden from view.

### Aura and Presence
- **Subtle Aura of Power:** Despite his frail appearance, there is a palpable aura of power around Elder Thorne. The air seems to hum faintly with energy when he is near, as if the very forest responds to his presence. Birds and small animals move closer, unafraid, drawn by his deep connection to the natural world.

- **Gentle Movements:** Elder Thorne’s movements are slow and deliberate, each step careful and measured. When he gestures, it is with a gentle grace, as though he is always mindful of the life around him. His voice, when he speaks, is soft but carries the weight of ages, resonating with a quiet authority that commands respect.
