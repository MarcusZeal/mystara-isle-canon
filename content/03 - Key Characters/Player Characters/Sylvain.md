### Journal of Rem


#### Day 14

I have been here for about two weeks now. At least, I think that’s how time is tracked here. I woke up in these strange woods, utterly disoriented. The world around me was vibrant and alien, so different from Earth. I was found by a group of druids from a place called Eldertree Grove. 

#### Day 97
I'm so glad they took me in. It took me a while, but I slowly began to understand my new reality. My name is no longer Sylvester; it is Sylvain. I have accepted this name as my own, leaving my past behind.

#### Year 13, Day 365

I have been “Sylvain” longer than I was “Sylvester” at this point. No one here has ever heard that name before, and I would prefer to keep it that way. My memories of Earth are still vivid, but they feel like a distant dream. Here in Mystara, everything makes sense. I fit in. I don’t know from where these powers have come, but I am much more formidable than I ever was back on Earth. I can fend for myself and help others if I choose to—options I never had before.

#### Year 15, Day 180

The Willowhart family, particularly Lila, has been incredibly kind to me. Lila took me in and treated me like kin from the moment I arrived. It felt like she understood me better than I did. I still remember her wide-eyed look when she first saw me and asked if I was an elf. She taught me what it meant to be an elf in Mystara and about elven culture. Her lessons have been invaluable.

#### Year 18, Day 200

**Elder Thorne** has become my mentor, teaching me the ways of the druids. Under his guidance, I’ve learned to harness the natural magic of this world. The power that flows through me feels natural, as if it was always meant to be a part of me. I am becoming stronger, more confident in my abilities. 

#### Year 60, Day 100

It has been over two decades since I last saw Lila. She has taught me much, including to save judgments for a creature’s character until it has been made plain. Her departure from Eldertree Grove was a turning point for me. I realized that there is a greater world out there, full of mysteries and adventures. It was time for me to venture out on my own.


#### Year 75, Day 30

About three months ago, I heard that Lila was living in [[North Lodge]]. I decided to visit her and see how she was doing. It was good to see her again. She told me about the blight of the goblins. Apparently, there have been numerous attacks, and the villagers are on edge. Lila, with her gentle heart, has taken a peculiar liking to the goblins that live beyond the Enchanted Glade. I set out beyond the glade and found a much larger, more civilized society of goblins than I ever expected.

#### Year 75, Day 60

I have befriended [[Grubnar Skull-Crusher]], the warchief of the goblins. Grubnar explained to me that something deep and sinister may be at the root of the recent goblin attacks. If the root of the problem is not dealt with, it may lead to more bloodshed on both sides. I cannot let that happen. We must find the cause and stop it.

#### Year 75, Day 90

At Grubnar’s request, I set out to the Hidden Ruins. This place is filled with ancient magic and secrets. I have stumbled upon some sort of riddle. If the hours I've spent pondering these answers are any indication, I think I may need help...

The spirits here are restless, and I can feel the weight of their knowledge pressing down on me. I must remain vigilant and find a way to uncover the truth...
