On earth, I was a failed musican. All I wanted to do was sing, dance, and make beautiful song to make those around me happy. However, all I did was disgust those around me with how awful I sounded. 

One day, while practicing playing the lute, a circle preformed around Eldric and transported him to these new lands. 

But, now, eldric can suddenly make sweet beautiful noise. 

Patrons from far and wide come to hear his sweet tune, and he now travels the land preforming for drink, coin, love, and to bring others that happiness he couldnâ€™t on earth
