## Backstory

**Percival "Percy" Sullivan**’s life changed in an instant. One moment, he was a 5'11" college student, half-asleep in his dorm, coasting through yet another major change. The next, he was a 2'2" halfling in a world he didn’t understand. His first twelve hours in Vodari were pure chaos. With no powers and no guidance, Percy’s survival depended on the skills he honed in his old life—critical thinking, quick reflexes, and a knack for improvisation, honed through countless hours of video games.

Despite the odds, he managed to fend off the dangers of this strange land. What truly defined him, however, was a moment of compassion. He came across a wounded traveler and, without hesitation, helped them to safety, using every scrap of ingenuity he had. What Percy didn’t know was that this stranger was no ordinary wanderer—it was Tero, the god of light, love, and healing, in disguise.

#### Meeting Tero

Impressed, Tero revealed himself eight hours ago. In a radiant flash, the god stood before Percy and began a long conversation. They spoke of Percy’s world, of Vodari, and of the god’s hidden grief. Through these hours, a bond formed—not of master and servant, but of equals in spirit. Tero saw in Percy a soul worth empowering, someone capable of holding great responsibility with the humility and kindness required of his mission.

In an awe-inspiring moment, Tero transformed Percy. The small halfling body shimmered, becoming an Aasimar, though still halfling in stature. The god granted him the powers of a cleric, a divine champion bound by purpose. With this power came a sacred mission: to restore Tero’s lost sister, Lupara, the goddess of the moon.

Before departing, Tero gave Percy one last piece of guidance. “There is a group, each driven by fate. Seek them near the portal. Together, your paths will intertwine, and the light of the moon may yet shine once more.”

**Percy:**

> Before I go... You seem far more powerful and I. If you can't resurrect your sister, how could I?

**Tero**:

_His golden eyes soften, and he places a gentle hand on your shoulder._

> "Power alone is not enough, Percy. My connection to Lupara was severed long ago, and with it, my ability to bring her back. It’s like trying to light a fire when you’ve lost the spark."

_He pauses, his expression thoughtful._

> "But you… you are different. You are of both worlds, unbound by the ancient rifts that keep us apart. Your perspective, your compassion, and your resilience are the keys. You can carry the spark where I cannot, rekindle the bond that was lost."

_He kneels slightly, meeting your eyes at your level._

> "Sometimes, it takes someone outside the divine to see the truth we gods overlook. That’s why it must be you."
>
> Now, Percy stands at the edge of the portal, ready to meet this destined party. He is no longer just a lost college student. He is a halfling Aasimar cleric, armed with divine power and a mission that could change the fate of Vodari forever.

**Percy:**

> I had a feeling this wasn't my world, were you the one who brought me here?

**Tero:** _His hand retreats, and a faint, almost wistful smile crosses his face._

> "No, Percy, it wasn’t me. Your arrival here was not of my design."

_His gaze drifts upward, as if searching the heavens for answers._

> "Something—or someone—brought you to Vodari for a reason beyond even my sight. I only recognized your potential once you were here. That’s why I reached out. But whoever pulled you from your world… their purpose remains hidden, even from me."

_His eyes meet yours again, steady and reassuring._

> "What I do know is that your presence here is no accident. You were meant for something greater, and together, we’ll uncover what that is."

**Percy**:

> The group of travelers I am waiting for, are they followers of yours as well? are they already on the quest to save lupara?

**Tero:** _He nods slowly, a glimmer of pride mixed with sadness in his eyes._

> "They do not yet realize it, but they walk the path toward Lupara’s salvation. Each of them has their own reasons, their own struggles, but fate has drawn them together. They are gathering Lunashards—fragments of my sister’s heart, scattered when she fell. Without those shards, her resurrection is impossible."

_His tone grows heavier, more serious._

> "But their journey is fraught with obstacles, chief among them Vyra. She was once a beacon of hope, a protector of this world. Now, she seeks to delay its progress, to stop the shards from being united. Her methods are harsh, even cruel, but her motives… they stem from fear. She believes that resurrecting Lupara could bring about another catastrophe."

_Tero’s voice softens, almost mournful._

> "Her heart, though misguided, is still rooted in a desire to protect. She fears what she cannot control. But fear has blinded her to the truth—that Vodari cannot thrive without balance. Without Lupara’s light, the world will wither."

_He looks at you with resolve._

> "You will help them see the greater purpose, Percy. Together, you’ll gather the shards, confront Vyra, and bring back the light of the moon. But be ready—convincing Vyra will be no simple task."

**Percy**: alright, yeah, I will thank him, tell him he can count on me and that if he thinks of anything else, if theres some other gods that need reviving or worlds that need saving to just let me know, I got this

**Tero**: _He places a hand over his chest and bows his head slightly, his fiery aura dimming to a warm glow._

> "Thank you, Percy. Your resolve does you credit, and I will not forget it. You carry more than divine power—you carry hope."

_He straightens, a faint smile on his lips._

> "I will call upon you if the need arises, and I have no doubt you will rise to meet it. But for now, focus on Lupara. Her light will guide Vodari, and perhaps, in time, reveal more of your own path."

_His form begins to shimmer and fade, his voice lingering in the air._

> "Go with my blessing, my friend. The flames of destiny burn brightly within you."
