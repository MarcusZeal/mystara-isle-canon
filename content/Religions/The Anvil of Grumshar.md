#### Overview

The anvil symbol found on the piece of cloth is the religious symbol of **Grumshar**, the goblin deity of craftsmanship and creation. Unlike other deities in goblin mythology who often emphasize war and destruction, Grumshar is revered as the god of artisans, builders, and those who shape and create with their hands.

#### Symbolism

The **Anvil of Grumshar** represents the divine spark of creativity and the transformation of raw materials into tools, weapons, and art. The anvil itself is a powerful symbol of resilience, strength, and the enduring nature of crafted objects. It is often depicted as a sturdy anvil with intricate carvings, surrounded by symbols of the elements—fire, earth, and metal—highlighting the various forces involved in the act of creation.

#### Mythology

According to [[Goblins]]' lore, Grumshar was a master blacksmith and craftsman who discovered the secrets of forging powerful artifacts. He taught the [[goblins]] the art of smithing, building, and crafting, allowing them to create tools and weapons that ensured their survival and prosperity. Grumshar's teachings emphasized the importance of skill, patience, and the value of hard work.

#### Worship and Practices

Goblins who worship Grumshar often do so through acts of creation and craftsmanship. They believe that by forging, building, and crafting, they honor their deity and bring a piece of his divine essence into the world. Common practices include:

- **Crafting Rituals**: Goblins hold special rituals before starting any significant crafting project, asking for Grumshar's blessing and guidance. These rituals often involve offering a small crafted item as a token of respect.
- **Anvil Shrines**: Small shrines dedicated to Grumshar can be found in goblin settlements, usually near workshops and forges. These shrines feature a miniature anvil and are adorned with offerings of crafted items, tools, and symbols of the elements.
- **Festivals of Creation**: Goblins celebrate annual festivals in honor of Grumshar, where they showcase their best works, engage in crafting competitions, and share techniques and knowledge. These festivals foster a sense of community and pride in their craftsmanship.

#### Significance in the Campaign

The discovery of the anvil symbol on the piece of cloth suggests that the goblins involved in the recent attacks may have connections to a group or sect dedicated to Grumshar. This could indicate that their motives are not solely driven by aggression but may also involve a desire to protect or reclaim something of cultural or religious significance.

#### Possible Plot Hooks

- **Sacred Forge**: The goblins might be guarding a sacred forge or ancient workshop believed to be blessed by Grumshar. The players could uncover this location and decide whether to help protect it or explore its secrets.
- **Crafting Quest**: The players might be tasked with helping the goblins complete a significant crafting project, such as forging a powerful artifact, to gain their trust and cooperation.
- **Cultural Exchange**: The players could engage in a cultural exchange, learning goblin crafting techniques and sharing their own knowledge, fostering peace and understanding between their groups.

By understanding the significance of the Anvil of Grumshar, the players can gain insight into the goblins' culture and potentially find non-violent solutions to their conflicts, adding depth and complexity to their adventure.
