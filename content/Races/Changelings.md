### Changeling Race Lore

#### Overview

Changelings are a mysterious and elusive race known for their ability to shape-shift and assume the appearance of others. Predominantly perceived as evil, changelings are feared and mistrusted by other races due to their deceptive nature and involvement in nefarious activities. While there are exceptions to this rule, most changelings use their abilities for personal gain and manipulation.

#### Physical Appearance

In their true form, changelings have pale, almost colorless skin, with white or silver hair and solid-colored eyes. They are slender and slightly taller than humans, standing around 6 feet tall. However, changelings rarely reveal their true form, instead adopting the appearance of other races to blend in and achieve their goals.

#### Culture and Society

Changelings do not have a unified culture or society. Instead, they integrate into the societies of other races, using their shape-shifting abilities to live in secrecy. Their true identities are often hidden, even from those they interact with regularly. This secrecy is both a survival mechanism and a way to gain power and influence without drawing attention to their true nature.

**Key Aspects of Changeling Culture**:

- **Secrecy and Deception**: Changelings thrive on secrecy and deception. They are masters of disguise, able to seamlessly blend into any society by assuming different identities.
- **Individualism**: Unlike other races with strong communal ties, changelings are highly individualistic. Each changeling is responsible for their own survival and success, often working alone or in small, covert groups.
- **Manipulation and Control**: Changelings often use their abilities to manipulate and control others. They infiltrate positions of power and influence, using their knowledge and skills to achieve their goals.

#### Beliefs and Religion

Changelings do not have a unified belief system or pantheon of deities. Their individualistic nature means that religious practices vary widely among them. Some changelings may worship gods of trickery and deception, while others might revere deities of shadow and darkness.

**Common Deities**:

- **Mask, the God of Thieves**: Some changelings worship Mask, the god of thieves and shadows, seeking his favor for their deceptive endeavors.
- **Shar, the Mistress of the Night**: Others may revere Shar, the goddess of darkness and loss, finding solace in her embrace of shadows and secrets.
- **Beshaba, the Lady of Misfortune**: A few changelings might pray to Beshaba, the goddess of misfortune, hoping to bring bad luck to their enemies.

#### Role in Mystara Isle

Changelings are scattered across Mystara Isle, with no specific homeland. They can be found in every major city and settlement, including [[Eboncrest]], [[Dawnham]], and [[Ironheart]]. Due to their secretive nature, changelings are often involved in criminal activities, espionage, and other nefarious deeds.

**Key Locations**:

- **Urban Centers**: Changelings often gravitate towards large cities where they can easily blend in and exploit opportunities for manipulation and control.
- **Hidden Enclaves**: In remote areas, small enclaves of changelings may exist, living in secrecy and isolation from other races.

#### Modern-Day Perception

Changelings are universally feared and distrusted by other races. Their ability to assume any form makes them dangerous and unpredictable. While few truly understand the extent of their abilities, the mere rumor of a changeling's presence can cause panic and paranoia.

### Key Characteristics of Changelings

- **Shape-Shifting**: Changelings have the innate ability to alter their appearance at will, allowing them to assume the form of any humanoid race.
- **Deceptive Nature**: They are natural deceivers, skilled in manipulation and subterfuge. Their ability to adopt multiple identities makes them formidable spies and infiltrators.
- **Individualistic**: Changelings prioritize their own survival and success, often operating alone or in small, secretive groups.
- **Evil Tendencies**: While there are exceptions, most changelings are involved in criminal activities and other evil deeds, driven by a desire for power and control.
