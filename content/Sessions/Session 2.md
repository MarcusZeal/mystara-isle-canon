**NOTE: If at any point the players pickpocket or open a chest - or just go looking real hard for something they will find Torn Note Fragments 1 and 2.** 

### Scene 1: Entering the Hidden Cave

#### Setting the Scene

“As you enter the cave, you are immediately struck by the bustling activity within. “

##### Make a perception check. 

**Success**: You get the impression that this is a very, very large cave. Deep and sprawling. Full of tunnels and goblins. You notice right away that there are patches of luminescent fungi that cast a soft, otherworldly glow.

The air is cool and slightly damp - but not unpleasant it carries the mixed scents of earth, smoke, and cooking…. Meat? You can’t be sure what the meat is, but it smells delicious. 

#### Description of Goblin Activities

“As you walk deeper into the cave you notice goblins going about their daily lives. 

 You see several goblins are hard at work, hammering metal, weaving baskets, and shaping wood. The clinking of hammers and the rhythmic scraping of tools against materials create a constant background noise.

You see some goblins are engaged in heated discussions, their high-pitched voices echoing through the cave. Others are gathered around small fires, sharing food and stories, laughing, and occasionally shouting.

You see a group of young goblins is practicing combat skills, supervised by an older, more experienced warrior. They wield wooden swords and shields, their movements quick and eager.

You notice that not all of the goblins look the same… some look like Goblins but… different… somehow. 

---

As the players continue down the hallway the goblin scout escort makes conversation. 

“Right this way, funny-looking Gobins! Krag will like you!”

**Perception Check (DC 12)**:
- Success: 
	- You notice that the goblins are industrious and well-organized. They appear to be trading shiny rocks, food, and regular nesesities. 


**Insight Check (DC 10)**:
- Success: The players sense that the goblins are not hostile but rather cautious and curious about their presence.


**Nature Check (DC 10):**
- Fail: Yup. You’re definitely in a cave. 

#### Goblin Interactions

As the you walk deeper into the cave, the goblins notice them but do not react with immediate hostility. Instead, there is a mix of curiosity and cautious acceptance. 

You can hear snippets of conversations and see the goblins’ daily struggles and joys.

**Goblin Dialogue**:
- **Crafting Goblin**: "Careful with that edge! Grumshar doesn’t bless sloppy work. That’s not goblin."
- **Arguing Goblins**: "5 rocks for THIS? Hell no! I’ll give you 3 at most… and definitely not the smooth ones. "
- **Training Goblin**: "Keep your guard up! An enemy won’t wait for you to be ready!"
- Cautious Goblin: “Hey stay clear of the forge! I don’t want anymore brothers going up in flames…

You get the sense that these goblins have a society of their own. Different than humans… but a society nonetheless. 


#### Key Descriptions to Emphasize

- **Community and Complexity**: The players should get a sense that the goblins, while less sophisticated than humans, have a rich and complex society. They work together, argue, and support each other, showing a level of organization and community.
- **Variety of Roles**: Highlight the different roles within the goblin society, from craftsmen to warriors to caregivers, showcasing that goblins are more than just monsters.
- **Human-Like Qualities**: Despite their rough and often crude behavior, the goblins display emotions and actions similar to humans, such as pride in their work, care for their young, and a desire to protect their home.

### Scene 2: Meeting the Goblin "Leaders"

#### Setting the Scene

You enter a larger, more organized chamber within the cave. This area is better lit, with more permanent fixtures and signs of greater care in its upkeep. At the center of this chamber stands Krag Rock-Biter, a well-respected goblin within the community. He is surrounded by other goblin advisors and guards, creating an air of authority and significance.

**Key Descriptions**:
- **Krag Rock-Biter**: Krag is a formidable figure, his posture exuding confidence and strength. He wears a mix of leather and scrap armor, and his eyes are sharp and calculating.
- **Goblin Guards**: The guards are more disciplined and better equipped than the average goblins. They stand alert, watching the players with wary eyes.

#### Interaction with Krag Rock-Biter

**Krag Rock-Biter Dialogue**:
- **Greeting**: "Ah, you must be the Reinforcements ! Your arrival is timely. We have much work to do, and Grumshar’s blessing is with us."
- **Introduction**: "I am Krag Rock-Biter, a humble servant of our Chieftain and Grumshar. Welcome to our home."

**Insight Check (DC 13)**:
- Success: You get the sense that Krag is genuinely welcoming but also cautious and observant. He is large, but his eyes are kind.


#### Players’ Response

The players can choose to introduce themselves, ask questions about the goblin society, or inquire about the project Krag mentioned. Krag is open to discussion, eager to learn more about these supposed allies.

**Possible Player Questions**:
- "What is this project you’re working on?"
- "How can we assist you?"
- "What challenges are you facing?"

**Krag’s Responses**:
- **About the Project**: "Nothing in particular. We often make trinkets and scribbles. It is not goblin to build gaudy monuments."
- **How to Assist / Challenges**: "Lately, some of our kin have been acting strangely. They've been acting not goblin. **gasps**. I know, I know... but you've seen it too! There are those among us that would see us hunted or destroyed. They would see us throw away this cave. This community. That is not goblin. *They* are not goblin."

#### Clarification about Leadership

As the conversation progresses, Krag will clarify his role within the tribe and explain the goblin concept of leadership.

“Are you the goblin leader here?”  

- Oh hohohoho - No. No, I am not Chieftan. I am Krag. We goblins only have one chieftan. To Have many chieftains would be not-goblin. 


When its time to go… 

**Krag Rock-Biter Dialogue**:
- "I should clarify, I am not the Chieftain. We goblins believe that tribes have only a single Chieftain. To have more than one would be considered 'not-goblin.' 
- Our Chieftain is wise and strong, guiding us in all we do. He's deeper in the cave system. I'll take you to him when you’re ready. For now, feel free to take a look around."

#### Transition to the Next Part

As the players finish their conversation with Krag, they are invited to explore the rest of the cave and interact with the goblins. This will lead to further discoveries and subtle clues about the underlying threat affecting the goblin society.

#### Prestidigitation Fades

As the spell's magic fades, your true brands begin to reappear. The goblins around you murmur and glance at each other, their expressions a mix of curiosity and amusement. Krag Rock-Biter steps forward, a wry smile spreading across his face. He has been following you, keeping an eye on what you’re up to. 

"So, the illusion fades," he says, his voice echoing through the cavern. "But did you really think we believed you were goblins in flesh? No, it is not the skin that makes one goblin."

He gestures broadly to the surrounding goblins, who nod and murmur in agreement. 

"It is the heart, the mind," Krag continues. "It is the cunning, the ambition, the willingness to do whatever it takes to achieve one's goals. That is what makes someone **Goblin**."

He looks each of you in the eye, his expression growing serious.

"You showed us that you have the spirit of goblins, and that is why we accepted you. You proved that you are willing to think like us, to act like us. That is what matters. That is what is truly goblin."

The goblins around you nod in agreement, their initial surprise replaced by a renewed sense of respect.

"Now," Krag says, his smile returning, "let's go meet our Chieftain. For Grumshar, and for the future of our tribe."


### Scene 4: Venturing Deeper into the Hidden Cave

#### Setting the Scene

You descend to what the goblins refer to as **[[Grukthar Hollow]]**. This area is less bustling and more focused on strategic operations and storage, where the goblins prepare for more significant undertakings.



**Perception Check (DC 11)**:
- Success: The players notice the change in atmosphere and the more strategic nature of Grukthar Hollow. This layer feels almost like a barracks on Earth - at least what you’ve seen in movies. 



**Nature Check DC 10:**
- Pass: The glowing mushrooms are on this layer too. You’re pretty sure you could use these in a potion of some sort in the future - or sell them to the alchemist back in North Lodge - or find a use for them somewhere. 


#### Description of Grukthar Hollow

As you descend into Grukthar Hollow, the atmosphere changes. The luminescent fungi provide dim, eerie light, and the air feels cooler and more humid. The sounds of crafting and chatter from above fade, replaced by the occasional echo of organized conversations. 

**Key Points**:
- **Strategic Operations**: Goblins here are engaged in planning and preparation. Maps and plans are spread out on makeshift tables, and goblin leaders discuss logistics and strategies.
- **Storage and Armory**: The players see storerooms filled with supplies—food, weapons, and crafting materials. Goblin guards patrol the area, ensuring everything is secure.

**Insight Check (DC 12)**:
- Success: The players sense the tension and urgency among the goblins in Grukthar Hollow.
- Failure: The players might not pick up on the full extent of the tension but will still feel a general sense of unease.

#### Goblin Interactions

The players can interact with goblins focused on strategic roles, who are more guarded and suspicious than those above but still cooperative.

**Goblin Dialogue**:
- **Strategic Goblin**: "Stay sharp. The Chieftain’s plans must not be disrupted!"
- **Guarding Goblin**: "Who are they? Are they cleared to be here? We can’t afford mistakes!"

**Investigation Check (DC 13)**:
- Success: You find a strange note (Torn Note Fragments 1 or 2.)
- Failure: The players might not find the specific clues but will still sense something is off.

#### Discovering Vague Clues

While exploring Grukthar Hollow, the players come across subtle clues hinting at the presence of doppelgangers and the influence of the hags.

**Clues**:
- **Piece 1 of Torn Note**: "...our movements are being watched more closely. The Mistress has commanded us to be more cautious. We must avoid suspicion at all costs. Do not forget your disguise and blend in as best you can..."
- **Piece 2 of Torn Note**: "...recent disappearances have caused unrest among the goblins. They are starting to question each other. We need to divert their attention. Suggest that the changes are due to the influence of Grumshar's will. This should buy us more time..."
- **Whispered Conversations**: The players overhear hushed voices among some goblins discussing recent strange behavior and the mysterious disappearances of their kin.

**Dialogue**:
- **Concerned Goblin**: "Have you seen how he’s changed? It’s like he’s not the same goblin... Is he even Golbin?"
- **Wary Goblin**: "I don’t trust the newcomers. Too many strange things happening. Are we sure they’re Goblin."

**Perception Check (DC 10)**:
- Success: You overhear whispered conversations and notice the unease among the goblins.
- Failure: The players still sense the general tension but might miss specific details.

#### Key Descriptions to Emphasize

- **Tension and Suspicion**: The players should sense an undercurrent of tension and suspicion among the goblins in Grukthar Hollow. There is a noticeable difference in the atmosphere compared to the more bustling areas above.
- **Vague Clues**: The scattered pieces of the torn note and whispered conversations provide vague but intriguing hints about the true nature of the threat, without giving away too much.

#### Transition to the Next Scene

As the players piece together the clues and interact with the goblins in Grukthar Hollow, they begin to realize that something is deeply wrong. The strange behavior and disappearances suggest a hidden threat that they must uncover. The players are directed towards a more secure area where further secrets of the cave might be revealed.

---

### Scene 5: Transition to Grukthar Hollow

#### Setting the Scene

Having gathered information and observed the bustling life within the Hidden Cave, the players are now ready to venture deeper into the goblin settlement. They are guided by goblin escorts down a winding path, leading to the second level of the cave system, known as **Grukthar Hollow**. The descent is marked by a noticeable change in atmosphere, becoming cooler and more humid with each step.

**Perception Check (DC 12)**:
- Success: The players notice the increasing tension and vigilance among the goblins as they descend.


#### Description of the Descent

As the players make their way down, the luminescent fungi that illuminated the upper levels become sparser, replaced by strategically placed torches that cast long, flickering shadows on the rough cave walls. The air grows heavier, and the sounds of activity from above fade into a distant hum.

**Goblin Dialogue (Overheard)**:
- **Guarding Goblin 1**: "Keep your eyes open. We don’t need any more surprises."
- **Guarding Goblin 2**: "I heard Grubnar is not happy with the recent disturbances. Better not let him down."
- **Strategic Goblin**: "The Chieftain's plans must not be disrupted. Everything must go smoothly. That’s goblin."

#### Key Descriptions

- **Increasing Tension**: The players can sense the growing tension among the goblins as they descend. The goblins are more vigilant, their conversations laced with worry and suspicion.
- **Strategic Environment**: The deeper level has a more strategic and militaristic feel, with guards posted at regular intervals and storerooms filled with supplies and weapons.

#### Encounter with Grubnar, the Warchief

As you reach the entrance of what appears to be a hallway that leads to the war room, you are met by a group of goblin guards who escort you to a large chamber where Grubnar, the Warchief, is stationed. The chamber is dimly lit but well-organized, with maps and plans spread out on tables, indicating its importance.

**Goblin Guard Dialogue**:
- **Guard Leader**: "Follow us. Grubnar awaits. Do not stray from the path."

**Insight Check (DC 14)**:
- Success: The players sense the respect and authority Grubnar commands among the goblins. Grubnar means you know harm. 
- Failure: The players still understand Grubnar's significance but might miss the full extent of his influence.

### Scene 6: Grubnar’s Chamber

Entering the chamber, the players see Grubnar, a towering and formidable goblin warchief, commanding respect and authority. He is surrounded by his most trusted advisors and strategists, all of whom are deep in discussion about recent events and plans.

The guards escort you to stand directly in front of him... 

You stand before Grubnar, the Warchief of the goblin tribe in the heart of Gukthar Hollow. This area is a hub of strategic planning and military preparation, reflecting the gravity of the challenges the goblins face. 

**Key Descriptions**:
- **Grubnar**: A commanding figure with battle scars and a fierce demeanor, dressed in armor that signifies his status.
- **Advisors and Strategists**: Goblins around him are equipped with maps, weapons, and various tools, ready to assist in the planning and execution of their strategies.


**Grubnar Dialogue**:

- **Greeting**: “Welcome, Travelers. I am Grubnar, Warchief of this tribe. I heard of your little deception upstairs… Goblin indeed. You’ve come during a time of great need. I’ve been informed that you have offered assistance? ”
- **The Situation**: "Strange things have been happening in our domain. Goblins disappearing, others behaving oddly. We suspect an unseen enemy within our ranks. There are those amongst us who are NOT GOBLIN. They look like goblin. They smell like goblin. But they are not goblin. I am sure of it. No goblin of mine would attack North Lodge. My silly plant friend lives there. No goblin in my tribe would ever harm her. Not after how much she's done for us. Help us. Find out who's impersonating my people. Find them and kill them."

**Possible Player Questions**:
- "What do you need us to do?"
- "Have you discovered any clues about these disturbances?"
- "How can we help ensure the safety of your tribe?"

**Grubnar’s Responses**:
- **Tasks**: This cave system comes out in Bear Wood. There, you will find some old ruins and stairs leading down. No goblin to ever enter those stairs has ever come back. But we've seen 'goblins' coming out of there. Go there now. There you will find the answers you seek.
- **Clues**: "We have found some strange notes and symbols. They speak of a ‘Mistress’ and ‘shapeshifters.’ Be wary of whom you trust."
  - **The players are rewarded with torn note fragment 5 and 6.**
- **Support**: "Our resources are at your disposal. Take what you need and proceed with caution. We cannot afford any more losses."

**Investigation Check (DC 13)**:
- Success: You see there are some tracks on the ground that don't look quite the same as others. You can tell the difference between the larger and smaller tracks, but this third set of tracks is different in more than size and stature. They appear to be a completely different beast. 


#### Transition to Deeper Investigation

The players are now tasked with uncovering the mystery behind the disturbances and protecting the goblin tribe from the hidden threat, which will also stop the attacks on North Lodge.

The party never asked for aide from Grubnar, so they never received what he may have had to offer (potions, maps)

**Grubnar’s Final Words**:
- "Remember, trust no one. The enemy hides among us. Go now, and may Grumshar guide your steps."



### Scene 7: Ambush in Bear Wood


#### Setting the Scene

As the players leave Grukthar Hollow and head towards Bear Wood, the atmosphere grows increasingly tense. The thick canopy of trees creates a shadowy environment, and the silence is broken only by the occasional rustling of leaves and distant animal calls. The path is narrow and winding, leading deeper into the forest.

#### Description of the Ambush

Just as the players start to feel the weight of the journey, they are suddenly surrounded. From the shadows, two Barghests emerge, ready to attack.


- **Before Transformation**: "You should have stayed out of this. **You're not even from this world...** Now, you will face the wrath of the Mistress!"
  
- **After Transformation**: "Fools! We are not what we seem. Prepare to meet your end!"

### Note Fragments
![[note-6b.png]]![[note-1b.png]]![[note-2b.png]]![[note-3b.png]]![[note-4b.png]]![[note-5b.png]]


### Scene 8 Thistle Confrontation 

[[Posidonius, the Quantum Mage]], tired of [[Thistle the Kenku]]'s shenanigans began aggressively questioning Thistle after Thistle seemingly attacked him and [[Luke (Garos)]] unprovoked. 

After a long back and forth, they learn that Thistle is cursed and cannot speak. He can speak telepathically through his daggers though. Thistle was trying to speak to them each telepathically, but it looks aggressive. 

They left that heated conversation knowing more about each other. 

[[Luke (Garos)]] pointed out that the Barghests said that "you're not even from this world!" before attacking. Noticing that perhaps the antagonist knows that they are from Earth. It is here when the party revealed to one another that they were all from Earth. 

### Scene 9: Entering the Ruins

#### Setting the Scene

As the players enter the Hidden Ruins, they find themselves in a long hallway with ancient stone walls covered in moss and faint, glowing runes. At the end of the hallway, a set of stairs leads downward into the darkness.

---

### Scene 10: The Pillared Hall

#### Setting the Scene

As you walk down the stairs, you notice a large room with many large stone pillars lining either side. The pillars are adorned with intricate carving depicting scenes of an ancient civilization. 

You can tell that the civilization is the Eldoran. Your memory of earth can’t help but notice that this race reminds you a lot of elves. They look like elves, but their civilization was a lot more advanced. More like high elves from an old MMO you use to play. 

At the bottom of the stairs, the players enter a large room with massive stone pillars lining either side. The pillars are adorned with intricate carvings depicting scenes of ancient Eldoran life.

**Key Descriptions**:

- **Pillars**: Each pillar is carved with detailed scenes from Eldoran history, showing their culture and achievements.
- **Large Room**: The room is vast, with a high ceiling that echoes the players' footsteps.

**Runes on the Door**:

- **Inscription**: "To proceed beyond this frame, a key you must obtain. Seek the pool where spirits dwell, and retrieve what lies inside the well."


- **Eldoran Carvings**: The carvings on the pillars depict various aspects of Eldoran life, including their reverence for nature, their architectural achievements, and their downfall. Players who inspect the carvings closely can make a History check (DC 15) to gain insights into the Eldorans' history and the possible cause of their civilization's collapse.


- **Shapeshifter Tracks**: Mixed with the goblin tracks are odd, misshapen tracks that seem inconsistent. A successful Perception check (DC 14) suggests these could be the tracks of shapeshifters. Changelings.


---

### Scene 11: The Long Hallway

#### Setting the Scene

The players choose to travel down the long hallway to the right of the large room. The hallway is narrow and dark, with only the faint glow of luminescent fungi to light their way.

**Key Descriptions**:
- **Narrow Hallway**: The walls are close, with strange markings and occasional carvings of Eldoran symbols.
- **Dim Light**: The only illumination comes from patches of luminescent fungi growing in the cracks of the stone walls.

#### Transition to the Next Part

At the end of the hallway, the room opens up into a circular chamber.

---

### Scene 12: The Circular Room

#### Setting the Scene

The players enter a circular room with a drainage system at its center. The air here is damp and smells of stagnant water. 

##### Perception Check DC 12
Pass: You see a feint glow in the sewer

As they approach the drainage system, a rat scurries out, startling them.

**Key Descriptions**:
- **Circular Room**: The room is round, with a drainage grate near the center.
- **Drainage System**: The grate is old and rusted, with water slowly trickling through it.

#### Investigation

If the players investigate the drainage system, they discover a hidden apparatus that opens a concealed door to the north.

##### Investigation Check - DC 15

**Secret Door**:
- **Hidden Apparatus**: A cleverly disguised lever or button hidden in the drainage system activates the door.
- **Concealed Door**: The door opens with a low rumble, revealing a hidden passage leading north.

To the south, the players find a rectangular room with a pool of water. The pool is clear, with the faint glow of the key visible at the bottom.

The party finds a particularly talkative frog who reveals this information to them. Using this intel, they gain access to the hidden room where they find [[Aelorian's Essence]].
