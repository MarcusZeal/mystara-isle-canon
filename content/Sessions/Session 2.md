### Scene 1: Entering the Ruins

#### Setting the Scene

As the players enter the Hidden Ruins, they find themselves in a long hallway with ancient stone walls covered in moss and faint, glowing runes. At the end of the hallway, a set of stairs leads downward into the darkness.

**Key Descriptions**:
- **Long Hallway**: The hallway is lined with crumbling pillars and faintly glowing runes, casting eerie shadows on the walls.

### Scene 2: The Pillared Hall


#### Setting the Scene

At the bottom of the stairs, the players enter a large room with massive stone pillars lining either side. The pillars are adorned with intricate carvings depicting scenes of ancient Eldoran life.

**Key Descriptions**:

- **Pillars**: Each pillar is carved with detailed scenes from Eldoran history, showing their culture and achievements.
- **Large Room**: The room is vast, with a high ceiling that echoes the players' footsteps.

#### Points of Interest

- **To the Right**: An open door leads to a set of stairs descending further into the ruins.
- **To the Left**: A closed stone slab within a doorframe, covered in magical runes that glow faintly.

**Runes on the Door**:

- **Inscription**: "To proceed beyond this door, the key you must secure. Seek the pool where spirits dwell, and retrieve what lies beneath their spell."

#### Investigation

If the players inspect the door, they notice a circular indent in the stone slab, indicating a key is required to open it.

#### Interactions and Clues

- **Eldoran Carvings**: The carvings on the pillars depict various aspects of Eldoran life, including their reverence for nature, their architectural achievements, and their downfall. Players who inspect the carvings closely can make a History check (DC 15) to gain insights into the Eldorans' history and the possible cause of their civilization's collapse.
- **Goblin Tracks**: The players notice goblin tracks leading to the open door on the right. A successful Survival check (DC 12) reveals that these tracks are recent.
- **Doppelganger Tracks**: Mixed with the goblin tracks are odd, misshapen tracks that seem inconsistent. A successful Perception check (DC 14) suggests these could be the tracks of shapeshifters.

The ghosts will impart knowledge about Ignis, providing valuable lore for the players.

**Lore**:
- **Ignis, the Eternal Flame**: "Ignis is the embodiment of fire, the force that transforms and purifies. In the ancient times, the Eldorans revered Ignis for the power he bestowed upon their forges and the warmth he brought to their hearths."
- **Symbol of Creation and Destruction**: "Fire, under Ignis's watch, is a symbol of both creation and destruction. It can forge the strongest steel or reduce entire cities to ash. It is a reminder of the balance of power."
- **Eldoran Worship**: "In our time, we crafted great works and held grand ceremonies to honor Ignis, seeking his blessing in all our endeavors. The flames of Ignis burned brightly in our hearts and our homes."
