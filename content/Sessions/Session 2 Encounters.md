### Scene 6: Ambush in Bear Wood


#### Setting the Scene

As the players leave Grukthar Hollow and head towards Bear Wood, the atmosphere grows increasingly tense. The thick canopy of trees creates a shadowy environment, and the silence is broken only by the occasional rustling of leaves and distant animal calls. The path is narrow and winding, leading deeper into the forest.

#### Description of the Ambush

Just as the players start to feel the weight of the journey, they are suddenly surrounded. From the shadows, two Barghests emerge, ready to attack.

**Ambush Setup**:

- The Barghests have set up an ambush at a narrow part of the path where visibility is low.
- They use the element of surprise to their advantage, aiming to catch the players off guard.

**Enemies**:

- **2 Barghests** (stats from Monsters of the Multiverse, page 60)

**Abilities**:

- **Shapechanger**: Can use its action to polymorph into a goblin or back into its true form.
- **Innate Spellcasting**: Can cast Dimension Door once per day.
- **Keen Smell**: Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

**Actions**:

- **Multiattack**: The Barghest makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.
- **Bite**: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2d8 + 4 piercing damage.

#### Encounter Dialogue


- **Before Transformation**: "You should have stayed out of this. **You're not even from this world...** Now, you will face the wrath of the Mistress!"
  
- **After Transformation**: "Fools! We are not what we seem. Prepare to meet your end!"




#### Rewards

Upon defeating the Barghests, the players find the torn note fragments 3 and 4 on the bodies of the changelings.

**Loot**:
- **Torn Note Fragment 3**:
  - "...our primary objective remains unchanged. The Mistress requires the completion of the ritual. Ensure that all preparations are made in secrecy. Any deviation could be disastrous..."
- **Torn Note Fragment 4**:
  - "...remember the signal for when the time is right. The Mistress will guide us, but we must be ready to act swiftly. Trust no one outside our circle. The success of our mission depends on our ability to remain unseen..."



#### Conclusion

The players successfully fend off the ambush, securing the additional note fragments. They now have more pieces of the puzzle, hinting at the greater threat posed by the Mistress and her shapeshifting minions. With these clues in hand, they are better prepared to delve deeper into Bear Wood and uncover the hidden dangers that lie ahead.
