As you walk down the stairs, you notice a large room with many large stone pillars lining either side. The pillars are adorned with intricate carving depicting scenes of an ancient civilization. 

History Check DC 12
Pass: You can tell that the civilization is the Eldoran. Your memory of earth can’t help but notice that this race reminds you a lot of elves. They look like elves, but their civilization was a lot more advanced. More like high elves from an old MMO you use to play.

#### Interactions and Clues

- **Eldoran Carvings**: The carvings on the pillars depict various aspects of Eldoran life, including their reverence for nature, their architectural achievements, and their downfall.

- **Dialogue**: Read the epic monologue below....

##### Epic monologue for the Mistress:


As you step into the final chamber, the air grows thick with a palpable sense of dread. The dim, flickering light reveals the figure of the Mistress, standing tall and imposing. Her eyes gleam with an ancient wisdom twisted by centuries of dark ambition. Beside her, the withered Eldoran stands, a haunting reminder of the past.

"Ah, the brave adventurers," she begins, her voice echoing through the chamber. "You've come far, but did you really think you could stop me? Did you think you could understand the forces at play, the delicate balance I strive to maintain?"

She steps forward, her gaze piercing through each of you.

"You see, I was there when the world of Eldrath Isle was torn apart, when the very fabric of our existence was ripped asunder. I witnessed the folly of the Eldoran, their arrogance and their hubris. And it was I who sought to save what remained, to weave a new future from the ashes of the old."

Her voice grows colder, filled with a steely resolve.

"But the world is stubborn, resistant to change. The people of Mystara cling to their illusions of peace and stability, blind to the lurking chaos. I have spent centuries manipulating events, guiding destinies, all to prevent the same catastrophe from happening again. And yet, you stand in my way."

She raises a hand, and the room shudders with her power.

"You may call me a monster, but I am the only one who sees the truth. The only one who understands what must be done. The destruction of Balgaran, the doppelgangers, the attacks on your precious North Lodge—all necessary steps in my grand design. A design to save this world, even if it means sacrificing a few."

Her eyes blaze with an unholy light as she reaches the crescendo of her speech.

"You are pawns, unable to grasp the scope of my vision. But mark my words, heroes, you will not stop me. My work is far from done, and I will see it through to the end. And you will help me. Whether you know it or not."

With a dramatic flourish, she raises her arms, and a dark portal begins to form behind her.

"Farewell, Travelers. Continue your futile struggle if you must, but know that you will always be one step behind. The future of Mystara Isle is mine to shape, and I will not be denied."

As the portal engulfs her and her withered Eldoran companions, her voice lingers in the air, a chilling reminder of the darkness you face.

"And when the time comes, remember this moment. Remember that you faced the Vyra, [[The Mistress]] of Shadows; and you failed."

With that, she vanishes into the portal, leaving you in the eerie silence of the chamber, the weight of her words heavy upon your hearts.

### Aftermath in the Final Chamber

As the dark portal closes behind the Mistress and her withered Eldoran companions, an eerie silence settles over the chamber. The oppressive atmosphere lingers, a reminder of the powerful presence that was just here. The players stand amidst the remnants of ancient Eldoran architecture, their minds racing with the implications of what they've just heard and witnessed.

#### Immediate Reactions

Allow the players a moment to react to the Mistress's departure. They can discuss the monologue, express their feelings, and gather their thoughts. After this brief interlude, shift the focus to the mysterious teleportation circle that the Mistress left behind.

#### Investigating the Teleportation Circle

**Perception Check (DC 13)**:
- Success: The players notice faint, shimmering runes around the edge of the circle, pulsing with residual magical energy. They can also see the faint footprints and markings indicating recent use.
- Failure: The players still notice the circle but do not see the runes or recent activity markings.

**Arcana Check (DC 15)**:
- Success: The players discern that the circle is a teleportation portal, enchanted to allow quick travel between two fixed points. The magic is ancient, likely of Eldoran origin, but has been twisted and repurposed by the Mistress.
- Failure: The players can tell that the circle is magical but cannot determine its exact purpose or origin.

**Investigation Check (DC 14)**:
- Success: The players find subtle clues around the circle—scraps of torn notes, faint bloodstains, and symbols—that suggest it is used for covert operations. They find fragments of notes (3 and 4) detailing the Mistress's plans.
- Failure: The players do not find the fragments but may still deduce the circle's importance through discussion and reasoning.

#### Understanding the Circle's Purpose

**Insight Check (DC 12)**:
- Success: The players realize that the circle is a crucial tool for the Mistress's minions to launch attacks on North Lodge and other targets without detection.
- Failure: The players may still understand the circle's purpose through collaborative discussion and reasoning.

**History Check (DC 10)**:
- Success: Any player with knowledge of ancient Eldoran history recalls tales of teleportation magic used for swift movement across great distances, further confirming the circle's capabilities.
- Failure: The players miss the historical context but can still piece together the circle's function through other means.

#### Next Steps and Planning

Once the players understand the purpose of the circle, guide them towards deciding their next course of action:

**Purpose of the Circle**: The circle allows the Mistress's minions to teleport directly into the forest, bypassing traditional defenses.

**Next Steps**: The players must find a way to disable or disrupt the circle to stop the attacks on North Lodge. Possible options include:
- **Disrupting the Magic**: Using their own magical abilities or seeking the help of a powerful spellcaster to disrupt or deactivate the circle.
- **Physical Destruction**: Attempting to physically destroy the circle or its components, though this may require considerable effort and risk.
- **Seeking Allies**: Returning to North Lodge or another friendly settlement to gather support and resources to counteract the circle's influence.

#### Conclusion

As the players leave the final chamber, they carry with them the weight of the Mistress's words and the urgency of their mission. The path ahead is fraught with danger, but they now have a clearer understanding of the threat they face and the steps they must take to protect North Lodge and the world of Eldrath from the Mistress's dark ambitions.
