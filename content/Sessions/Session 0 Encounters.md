### Session 0 Encounters

As the players complete their character creation and background discussions at The Resting Stag inn, they will be given their first quest to investigate the recent goblin attacks. This will lead them to the Enchanted Glade, the first zone in Eldoria Forest. Here are a few planned encounters to introduce them to the dangers of the forest.

---

### Encounter 1: Wolf Pack Ambush

- **Setup**: As the players enter the Enchanted Glade, they hear the distant howls of wolves. The dense foliage and eerie, perpetual twilight of the glade provide ample cover for predators. Suddenly, a pack of wolves emerges from the underbrush, circling the players.
- **Enemies**: 5 Wolves
- **Tactics**:
  - The wolves use pack tactics to their advantage, targeting the weakest or most isolated player.
  - They may attempt to surround a player, using their numbers to overwhelm.
- **Objective**: Defeat the wolves and continue exploring the glade.
- **Rewards**: Players can find 20 silver pieces and a torn piece of cloth with a mysterious symbol near the wolves' den.

**Wolf (5)**
- AC: 13
- HP: 11 each
- Attack: Bite (+4 to hit, 2d4+2 piercing)
- Special: Pack Tactics (advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the wolf's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated)

### Encounter 2: Bear Encounter

- **Setup**: As the players continue through the glade, they come across a clearing with a bubbling stream. A large bear is fishing in the stream, oblivious to their presence. The bear is territorial and may attack if it feels threatened.
- **Enemies**: 1 Brown Bear
- **Tactics**:
  - The bear charges the nearest player, using its Multiattack to swipe with its claws and bite.
  - If the bear is reduced to half its hit points, it may try to retreat to protect itself.
- **Objective**: Defeat or scare off the bear to secure the clearing.
- **Rewards**: The players find a small pouch caught in the bearâ€™s fur containing a healing potion and 15 silver pieces.

**Brown Bear (1)**
- AC: 11
- HP: 34
- Attack: Multiattack (one with its bite and one with its claws)
  - Bite: (+5 to hit, 1d8+4 piercing)
  - Claws: (+5 to hit, 2d6+4 slashing)

### Encounter 3: Giant Spider Ambush

- **Setup**: Deeper in the glade, the players notice an area where the trees are covered in thick webs. Giant spiders have made their home here, waiting for prey to become entangled.
- **Enemies**: 3 Giant Spiders
- **Tactics**:
  - The spiders use their Web ability to restrain players and then move in for a bite attack.
  - They prefer to attack from above, dropping down on unsuspecting players.
- **Objective**: Avoid or break free from the webs and defeat the spiders.
- **Rewards**: In the spiders' lair, players find a desiccated corpse with a pouch containing 30 silver pieces, a small emerald worth 50 gold pieces, and a scroll of web.

**Giant Spider (3)**
- AC: 14
- HP: 26 each
- Attack: Bite (+5 to hit, 1d8+3 piercing plus 2d8 poison damage)
- Special: Web (Recharge 5-6, ranged weapon attack, +5 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one creature. The target is restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 12 Strength check, escaping if it succeeds. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed.)

### Encounter 4: Deer Herd

- **Setup**: As the players continue their exploration, they come across a herd of deer grazing peacefully. This encounter is non-combative and offers a moment of calm and beauty in the otherwise dangerous forest.
- **Narrative**: The deer look up as the players approach but do not flee. This can be a good opportunity for players to use their skills in Animal Handling or Nature to learn more about the forest.
- **Objective**: Observe or interact with the deer to gain insights into the forest.
- **Rewards**: If players successfully interact with the deer (e.g., feeding or calming them), they might find a hidden glade with rare herbs that can be used as potion ingredients (worth 20 gold pieces).

### Encounter 5: Goblin Scouts

- **Setup**: Near the edge of the glade, the players encounter a group of goblin scouts who are surveying the area. These goblins are part of the larger threat the players are investigating.
- **Enemies**: 4 Goblin Scouts
- **Tactics**:
  - The goblins use their Nimble Escape ability to hide and attack from cover.
  - They may attempt to flee and warn their comrades if the battle turns against them.
- **Objective**: Defeat the scouts and gather information about the goblin activity in the area.
- **Rewards**: On the scouts, the players find a crude map of the surrounding forest with several marked locations, 20 silver pieces, and a note in Goblin detailing orders from Krag Rock-Biter.

**Goblin Scout (4)**
- AC: 13 (Leather Armor)
- HP: 12 each
- Attack: Scimitar (+4 to hit, 1d6+2 slashing) or Shortbow (+4 to hit, 1d6+2 piercing)
