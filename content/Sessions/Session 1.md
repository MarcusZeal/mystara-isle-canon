#### Narrative Recap

---

The adventure began in the quaint village of [[North Lodge]], a place where the simple rhythms of daily life are rarely disturbed. Yet, recently, the village has been plagued by strange and unsettling goblin attacks, disrupting the peace. The local alchemist, [[Lila the Herbalist]], suspecting that not all goblins are responsible for the violence, persuaded you to investigate further rather than resort to immediate violence against the [[Goblins]].

Your journey took you into the Enchanted Glade, a mystical part of Eldoria Forest where reality and fantasy blur. Here, you encountered various wildlife, some friendly - others not so much; before finding some scout goblins.

Using your wits and a clever spell, you convinced them that you were allies by displaying the symbol of Grumshar, the goblin deity of craftsmanship and creation.

The goblins, believing you to be friendly reinforcements, welcomed you. You now stand on the threshold of the Hidden Cave, ready to delve deeper into the heart of goblin society. 

You aim to uncover the truth behind the recent attacks and learn more about the goblins who live here.

### Scene 1: Entering the Hidden Cave

#### Setting the Scene

As the players step into the Hidden Cave, they are immediately struck by the bustling activity within. The cave is a sprawling network of tunnels and chambers, illuminated by patches of luminescent fungi that cast a soft, otherworldly glow. The air is cool and slightly damp, carrying the mixed scents of earth, smoke, and cooking food.

#### Description of Goblin Activities

The players observe goblins of all ages going about their daily lives:

- **Crafting and Working**: Several goblins are hard at work, hammering metal, weaving baskets, and shaping wood. The clinking of hammers and the rhythmic scraping of tools against materials create a constant background noise.
- **Arguing and Socializing**: Some goblins are engaged in heated discussions, their high-pitched voices echoing through the cave. Others are gathered around small fires, sharing food and stories, laughing, and occasionally shouting.
- **Training and Sparring**: In one corner, a group of young goblins is practicing combat skills, supervised by an older, more experienced warrior. They wield wooden swords and shields, their movements quick and eager.

#### Goblin Interactions

As the players walk deeper into the cave, the goblins notice them but do not react with immediate hostility. Instead, there is a mix of curiosity and cautious acceptance. The players can hear snippets of conversations and see the goblins’ daily struggles and joys.

**Goblin Dialogue**:
- **Crafting Goblin**: "Careful with that edge! Grumshar doesn’t bless sloppy work. That’s not goblin."
- **Arguing Goblins**: "You took my spot! Get your own!"
- **Training Goblin**: "Keep your guard up! An enemy won’t wait for you to be ready!."

#### Key Descriptions to Emphasize

- **Community and Complexity**: The players should get a sense that the goblins, while less sophisticated than humans, have a rich and complex society. They work together, argue, and support each other, showing a level of organization and community.
- **Variety of Roles**: Highlight the different roles within the goblin society, from craftsmen to warriors to caregivers, showcasing that goblins are more than just monsters.
- **Human-Like Qualities**: Despite their rough and often crude behavior, the goblins display emotions and actions similar to humans, such as pride in their work, care for their young, and a desire to protect their home.

#### Transition to Scene 2

As the players move deeper into the cave, guided by the friendly goblin scouts, they are led to a central area where the leadership of the goblin community resides. The noise of daily activity fades slightly, replaced by a sense of anticipation and importance.

---

### Scene 2: Meeting the Goblin Leaders

#### Setting the Scene

The players enter a larger, more organized chamber within the cave. This area is better lit, with more permanent fixtures and signs of greater care in its upkeep. At the center of this chamber stands Krag Rock-Biter, a well-respected goblin within the community. He is surrounded by other goblin advisors and guards, creating an air of authority and significance.

**Key Descriptions**:
- **Krag Rock-Biter**: Krag is a formidable figure, his posture exuding confidence and strength. He wears a mix of leather and scrap armor, and his eyes are sharp and calculating.
- **Goblin Guards**: The guards are more disciplined and better equipped than the average goblins. They stand alert, watching the players with wary eyes.

#### Interaction with Krag Rock-Biter

**Krag Rock-Biter Dialogue**:
- **Greeting**: "Ah, you must be the reinforcements! Your arrival is timely. We have much work to do, and Grumshar’s blessing is with us."
- **Introduction**: "I am Krag Rock-Biter, a humble servant of our Chieftain and Grumshar. Welcome to our home."

#### Players’ Response

The players can choose to introduce themselves, ask questions about the goblin society, or inquire about the project Krag mentioned. Krag is open to discussion, eager to learn more about these supposed allies.

**Possible Player Questions**:
- "What is this project you’re working on?"
- "How can we assist you?"
- "What challenges are you facing?"

**Krag’s Responses**:
- **About the Project**: "Nothing in particular. We often make trinkets and scribbles. It is not goblin to build gaudy monuments. 
- **How to Assist /  Challenges**: "Lately, some of our kin have been acting strangely. They've been acting not goblin. **gasps**. I know, I know... but you've seen it too! There are those among us that would see us hunted or destroyed. They would see us throw away this cave. This community. That is not goblin. *They* are not goblin."

#### Clarification about Leadership

As the conversation progresses, Krag will clarify his role within the tribe and explain the goblin concept of leadership.

**Krag Rock-Biter Dialogue**:
- "I should clarify, I am not the Chieftain. We goblins believe that tribes have only a single Chieftain. To have more than one would be considered 'not-goblin.' Our Chieftain is wise and strong, guiding us in all we do. He's deeper in the cave system. I'll take you to him."

#### Transition to the Next Part

As the players finish their conversation with Krag, they are invited to explore the rest of the cave and interact with the goblins. This will lead to further discoveries and subtle clues about the underlying threat affecting the goblin society.

- **Variety of Roles**: Highlight the different roles within the goblin society, from craftsmen to warriors to caregivers, showcasing that goblins are more than just monsters.
- **Human-Like Qualities**: Despite their rough and often crude behavior, the goblins display emotions and actions similar to humans, such as pride in their work, care for their young, and a desire to protect their home.


### Scene 4: Venturing Deeper into the Hidden Cave

#### Setting the Scene

After their conversation with Krag Rock-Biter and interactions with the goblin community, the players are guided deeper into the Hidden Cave. They descend to what the goblins refer to as the second level, known as **Grukthar Hollow**. This area is less bustling and more focused on strategic operations and storage, where the goblins prepare for more significant undertakings.

#### Description of Grukthar Hollow

As the players descend into Grukthar Hollow, the atmosphere changes. The luminescent fungi provide dim, eerie light, and the air feels cooler and more humid. The sounds of crafting and chatter from above fade, replaced by the occasional echo of distant activity.

**Key Points**:
- **Strategic Operations**: Goblins here are engaged in planning and preparation. Maps and plans are spread out on makeshift tables, and goblin leaders discuss logistics and strategies.
- **Storage and Armory**: The players see storerooms filled with supplies—food, weapons, and crafting materials. Goblin guards patrol the area, ensuring everything is secure.

#### Goblin Interactions

The players can interact with goblins focused on strategic roles, who are more guarded and suspicious than those above but still cooperative.

**Goblin Dialogue**:
- **Strategic Goblin**: "Stay sharp. The Chieftain’s plans must not be disrupted!"
- **Guarding Goblin**: "Who are they? Are they cleared to be here? We can’t afford mistakes! "

#### Discovering Vague Clues

While exploring Grukthar Hollow, the players come across subtle clues hinting at the presence of doppelgangers and the influence of the hags.

**Clues**:
- **Piece 1 of Torn Note**: "...our movements are being watched more closely. The Mistress has commanded us to be more cautious. We must avoid suspicion at all costs. Do not forget your disguise and blend in as best you can..."
- **Piece 2 of Torn Note**: "...recent disappearances have caused unrest among the goblins. They are starting to question each other. We need to divert their attention. Suggest that the changes are due to the influence of Grumshar's will. This should buy us more time..."
- **Whispered Conversations**: The players overhear hushed voices among some goblins discussing recent strange behavior and the mysterious disappearances of their kin.

**Dialogue**:
- **Concerned Goblin**: "Have you seen how he’s changed? It’s like he’s not the same goblin... That’s not goblin."
- **Wary Goblin**: "I don’t trust the newcomers. Too many strange things happening. That’s not goblin."

#### Key Descriptions to Emphasize

- **Tension and Suspicion**: The players should sense an undercurrent of tension and suspicion among the goblins in Grukthar Hollow. There is a noticeable difference in the atmosphere compared to the more bustling areas above.
- **Vague Clues**: The scattered pieces of the torn note and whispered conversations provide vague but intriguing hints about the true nature of the threat, without giving away too much.

#### Transition to the Next Scene

As the players piece together the clues and interact with the goblins in Grukthar Hollow, they begin to realize that something is deeply wrong. The strange behavior and disappearances suggest a hidden threat that they must uncover. The players are directed towards a more secure area where further secrets of the cave might be revealed.

#### Setting the Scene

Having gathered information and observed the bustling life within the Hidden Cave, the players are now ready to venture deeper into the goblin settlement. They are guided by goblin escorts down a winding path, leading to the second level of the cave system, known as **Grukthar Hollow**. The descent is marked by a noticeable change in atmosphere, becoming cooler and more humid with each step.

#### Description of the Descent

As the players make their way down, the luminescent fungi that illuminated the upper levels become sparser, replaced by strategically placed torches that cast long, flickering shadows on the rough cave walls. The air grows heavier, and the sounds of activity from above fade into a distant hum.

**Goblin Dialogue (Overheard)**:
- **Guarding Goblin 1**: "Keep your eyes open. We don’t need any more surprises."
- **Guarding Goblin 2**: "I heard Grubnar is not happy with the recent disturbances. Better not let him down."
- **Strategic Goblin**: "The Chieftain's plans must not be disrupted. Everything must go smoothly. That’s goblin."

#### Key Descriptions

- **Increasing Tension**: The players can sense the growing tension among the goblins as they descend. The goblins are more vigilant, their conversations laced with worry and suspicion.
- **Strategic Environment**: The deeper level has a more strategic and militaristic feel, with guards posted at regular intervals and storerooms filled with supplies and weapons.

#### Encounter with Grubnar, the Warchief

As the players reach the entrance to Grukthar Hollow, they are met by a group of goblin guards who escort them to a large chamber where Grubnar, the Warchief, is stationed. The chamber is dimly lit but well-organized, with maps and plans spread out on tables, indicating its importance.

**Goblin Guard Dialogue**:
- **Guard Leader**: "Follow us. Grubnar awaits. Do not stray from the path."

The players now stand before Grubnar, the Warchief of the goblin tribe, in the heart of Grukthar Hollow. This area is a hub of strategic planning and military preparation, reflecting the gravity of the challenges the goblins face.

**Key Descriptions**:
- **Grubnar**: A commanding figure with battle scars and a fierce demeanor, dressed in armor that signifies his status.
- **Advisors and Strategists**: Goblins around him are equipped with maps, weapons, and various tools, ready to assist in the planning and execution of their strategies.

#### Interaction with Grubnar

**Grubnar Dialogue**:
- **Greeting**: "I have heard much about your arrival. Our scouts speak highly of you. We welcome any aid you can provide."
- **The Situation**: "Strange things have been happening in our domain.  Goblins disappearing, others behaving oddly. We suspect an unseen enemy within our ranks.  There are those amongst us who are NOT GOBLIN. They look like goblin. They smell like goblin. But they are not goblin. I am sure of it. No goblin of mine would attack North Lodge. My silly plant friend lives there. No goblin in my tribe would ever harm her. Not after how much she's done for us. Help us. Find out who's impersonating my people. Find them and kill them. "


**Possible Player Questions**:
- "What do you need us to do?"
- "Have you discovered any clues about these disturbances?"
- "How can we help ensure the safety of your tribe?"

**Grubnar’s Responses**:
- **Tasks**: This cave system comes out in Bear Wood. There, you will find some old ruins and stairs leading down. No goblin to ever enter those stairs has ever come back. But we've seen 'goblins' coming out of there. Go there now. There you will find the answers you seek. 
- **Clues**: "We have found some strange notes and symbols. They speak of a ‘Mistress’ and ‘shapeshifters.’ Be wary of whom you trust." 
	- **The players are rewarded with torn note fragment 5 and 6.** 
- **Support**: "Our resources are at your disposal. Take what you need and proceed with caution. We cannot afford any more losses."

#### Transition to Deeper Investigation

Grubnar provides the players with additional supplies and a more detailed map of Bear Wood and Grukthar Hollow. The players are now tasked with uncovering the mystery behind the disturbances and protecting the goblin tribe from the hidden threat, which will also stop the attacks on North Lodge.

**Supplies Provided**:
- A small bag of healing herbs (equivalent to a 5 healing potions)
- A detailed map of The Hidden Cave, Grukthar Hollow, and Bear Wood.
- Basic rations and water for their journey
- A **LONG**-REST if they choose to take one. They can sleep at any of the tents in the Goblin Cave, or they can go back to the inn before heading back out. 

**Grubnar’s Final Words**:
- "Remember, trust no one. The enemy hides among us. Go now, and may Grumshar guide your steps."

As the players leave Grukthak Hollow to Bear Wood they are ambushed by a group of 2 Borghats and 2 changelings. 

After defeating these body changers, they receive :
- **Torn Note fragments 3 and 4.**
