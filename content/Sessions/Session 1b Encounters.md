### Hidden Cave (Peaceful Encounter with a Twist)

#### Overview

The Hidden Cave, located within the Enchanted Glade of Eldoria Forest, is a bustling yet peaceful goblin settlement. The goblins here are craftsmen and traders, living under the guidance of their deity, Grumshar. They mistakenly believe the players are friendly goblins sent to help with a significant project. However, the recent attacks on the village are not by these goblins but by Barghests, malevolent creatures that can disguise themselves as goblins and have a deep hatred for them.

### Encounter 6: The Barghest Deception

- **Setup**: As the players prepare to leave the Hidden Cave with the map, they encounter a group of goblins who seem different—more sinister and aggressive. These are actually Barghests disguised as goblins, sent to disrupt and sabotage the goblin society.
- **Enemies**: 3 Barghests (disguised as goblins)
- **Tactics**:
  - The Barghests reveal their true forms if the players confront them.
  - They use their shape-shifting abilities and dark magic to attack the players.
  - Their goal is to eliminate any threats to their plan of sowing chaos among the goblins.
- **Objective**: Defeat the Barghests and uncover the truth behind the attacks.

**Barghest Dialogue (in disguise)**:

- "You think you can just waltz in here and take over? We won’t let that happen!"
- "Grumshar’s blessings mean nothing! Power belongs to those who can seize it!"

**Barghest Dialogue (revealed)**:

- "Fools! We are the true power here. Your time is over!"
- "We will destroy you and the goblins you protect!"

#### Rewards

- **Barghests' Loot**: Upon defeating the Barghests, the players find dark tokens of their magic, including 50 gold pieces, a potion of invisibility, and a cursed amulet that, if identified, reveals its ability to grant shape-shifting powers at a cost.

#### Conclusion

The Hidden Cave now serves as a peaceful goblin settlement initially, but with a twist revealing the true culprits behind the attacks. The players' interaction with the goblins and the Barghests adds depth to the narrative, emphasizing role-playing, diplomacy, and uncovering hidden threats. The map to the Goblin Lair, given by Krag Rock-Biter, provides a clear path for the next stage of their adventure.
