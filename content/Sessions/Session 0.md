**1. Welcome and Introduction**

- **Campaign Overview**: Briefly introduce [[Mystara Isle - World Map]] and the main themes of the campaign.
  - Setting: Mystara Isle, a land filled with magic, mystical creatures, and hidden dangers.
  - Starting Point: The village of North Lodge, where the players begin their journey.
  - Key Locations: [[Eldoria Forest]], [[Dragonspire Mountains]], [[Eboncrest]], [[Dawnham]], [[Copper Hill]], and more.

**2. Player Introductions**

- Have each player introduce themselves and their character.

  - Any specific goals or motivations for their character

**3. Campaign Mechanics**

- **Flexible Participation**: Explain the drop-in/drop-out nature of the campaign.
  - **Inn Mechanic**: New players join the group and departing players exit at inns located in each city.
  - **Missed Sessions**: If a player misses a session, their character is canonically preoccupied or resting. They will still gain experience to keep up with the party.
- **No Encumbrance Rules**: Bags of holding are commonplace in this world, so carrying capacity is not a concern.

**4. Setting Expectations**

- **Game Tone**: Discuss the tone of the game (e.g., serious, light-hearted, a mix).
- **Player Conduct**: Emphasize the importance of respect and collaboration among players.
- **Gameplay Style**: Discuss the balance between role-playing, combat, and exploration.
- **Metagaming**: Encourage players to make decisions based on their character’s knowledge and perspective, not player knowledge. 
	- Just because you know something is a certain way in the PHB or D&D material doesn't mean your character does - it also doesn't mean I'm going to play it the same way. :P 
	- Also, this Wiki is entirely public.  If you're a developer, you likely know how to see all my draft pages. Don't ruin the campaign for yourself by doing that. <3 

**5. Character Integration**

- Discuss how each character arrived in Mystara Isle, ensuring it aligns with the campaign’s lore.
  - Example: Characters are transported from Earth to Mystara Isle under mysterious circumstances, now inhabiting bodies with mystical powers.
- Address any specific plot hooks or connections to the campaign’s main storyline.
- Encourage players to think about their character’s relationships with other party members.

**6. World Building**

- **Wiki Resource**: Introduce the campaign wiki where players can find world-building details, character information, and campaign notes.
  - **Contents**: Lore, NPC profiles, important locations, session summaries, etc.
