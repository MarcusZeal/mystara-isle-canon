**3. Campaign Mechanics**

- **Flexible Participation**: Explain the drop-in/drop-out nature of the campaign.
  - **Inn Mechanic**: New players join the group and departing players exit at inns located in each city.
  - **Missed Sessions**: If a player misses a session, their character is canonically preoccupied or resting. They will still gain experience to keep up with the party.

- **Player Conduct**: Emphasize the importance of respect and collaboration among players.
- **Gameplay Style**: Discuss the balance between role-playing, combat, and exploration.
- **Metagaming**: Encourage players to make decisions based on their character’s knowledge and perspective, not player knowledge. 
	- Just because you know something is a certain way in the PHB or D&D material doesn't mean your character does - it also doesn't mean I'm going to play it the same way. :P 
	- Also, this Wiki is entirely public.  If you're a developer, you likely know how to see all my draft pages. Don't ruin the campaign for yourself by doing that. <3 

**5. Character Integration**

- Discuss how each character arrived in Mystara Isle, ensuring it aligns with the campaign’s lore.
  - Example: Characters are transported from Earth to Mystara Isle under mysterious circumstances, now inhabiting bodies with mystical powers.
- Address any specific plot hooks or connections to the campaign’s main storyline.
- Encourage players to think about their character’s relationships with other party members.
