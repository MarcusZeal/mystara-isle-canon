#### Setting the Scene

**Starting Point**: The adventurers begin at the Adventurers' Guild in Eboncrest, where they receive the quest details and a basic map showing the location of the old mines.

**Old Mines Entrance**: The adventurers arrive at the entrance of the old mines, a dark and foreboding tunnel descending into the earth. The area is eerily quiet, with an occasional echo of distant sounds emanating from within.

### Scene 1: Investigating the Mine Entrance

#### Setting the Scene

As you approach the entrance of the old mines, the air grows cooler, and a faint, musty smell fills your nostrils. The entrance is partially collapsed, with wooden beams supporting the rocky ceiling. Faint echoes of distant noises can be heard from deep within the mine.

**What You Don't See**: The source of the strange noises remains hidden, creating an atmosphere of suspense and tension.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **What kind of noises have been reported?**
   - **Response**: "Miners and locals have reported hearing scratching, growling, and occasionally voices. No one has dared to go deep enough to find out more."

2. **How long have the disturbances been occurring?**
   - **Response**: "The noises started a few weeks ago and have been growing more frequent. People are getting scared."

3. **Is there any known history of these mines?**
   - **Response**: "These mines were abandoned years ago after a series of collapses. There are rumors of hidden treasures and forgotten tunnels."

#### Investigation and Clues

**Perception Check (DC 12)**:
- Success: You notice fresh tracks leading into the mine, suggesting recent activity.
- Failure: The entrance appears undisturbed, but the sense of unease remains.

**Survival Check (DC 14)**:
- Success: The tracks are humanoid but unusual, possibly indicating kobolds or bandits.
- Failure: The tracks are difficult to discern in the dim light and uneven ground.

### Scene 2: Entering the Mines

#### Setting the Scene

Following the tracks, you descend into the mines. The tunnel walls are rough-hewn and supported by ancient wooden beams. The air is thick with dust, and the faint sound of dripping water echoes through the dark passages.

The deeper parts of the mine remain hidden in darkness, with the occasional glint of something reflective catching your eye.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **What do the tracks lead to?**
   - **Response**: The tracks wind deeper into the mine, leading you to a fork in the path with tunnels branching off in different directions.

2. **Are there any signs of recent activity?**
   - **Response**: A successful Perception check (DC 13) reveals disturbed dust and scattered tools, indicating recent movement.

3. **Is there anything unusual about the tunnels?**
   - **Response**: A successful Investigation check (DC 14) uncovers hidden symbols and markings, possibly left by kobolds or bandits to navigate the mine.

#### Encounter: Tunnel Ambush

As you venture deeper, you are ambushed by a group of kobolds or bandits lying in wait.

**Combat Encounter**:
- **Kobolds** (use Kobold stats from the Monster Manual) - 6 kobolds, using guerrilla tactics and traps.
- **Bandits** (use Bandit stats from the Monster Manual) - 4 bandits, using the narrow tunnels to their advantage.

**Tactics**: The enemies use the narrow tunnels to create chokepoints and ambush the adventurers. They will try to retreat deeper into the mine if overwhelmed.

### Scene 3: The Hidden Chamber

#### Setting the Scene

After dealing with the ambush, you discover a hidden chamber deep within the mine. The chamber is larger, with a high ceiling and ancient mining equipment scattered around. The walls are lined with veins of precious minerals, glittering faintly in the light.

After defeating the leader and their followers, you secure the chamber and ensure no further threats remain. You find evidence of their plans and any stolen goods they might have hidden.

The mine is now quiet, with only the sound of dripping water and the faint echo of your footsteps.

#### Potential Questions and Answers
