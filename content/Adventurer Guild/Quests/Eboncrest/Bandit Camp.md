### Scene 1: Investigating the Caravan Site

#### Setting the Scene

As you approach the caravan site, you see the remnants of wagons and scattered goods. The air is filled with the scent of burnt wood and the sounds of groaning survivors. The site is a stark reminder of the brutality of the bandit attacks.

**What You Don't See**: Despite the obvious signs of a raid, the bandits themselves are nowhere in sight, leaving only clues behind.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

3. **Do you know where they came from?**
   - **Response**: "They fled towards the mountains after taking everything. We've heard rumors of a camp hidden somewhere up there."

#### Investigation and Clues

**Perception Check (DC 12)**:
- Success: You notice tracks leading towards the mountains, along with some hastily discarded items that might have fallen from the bandits' loot.
- Failure: The tracks are difficult to follow, blending in with the natural terrain.

**Survival Check (DC 14)**:
- Success: You can clearly follow the trail of the bandits, noting that they travel in groups and seem to have a well-trodden path to their camp.
- Failure: The trail is confusing, and you might lose it if not careful.

### Scene 2: Tracking the Bandits

#### Setting the Scene

Following the tracks, you venture into the mountains. The terrain becomes increasingly rugged and challenging, with steep paths and rocky outcrops. The bandits have chosen a difficult but strategic location for their camp.

**What You Don't See**: Despite the harsh terrain, signs of the bandits' presence become more apparent, with occasional broken branches and discarded items.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **How far into the mountains do the tracks go?**
   - **Response**: The tracks lead deep into the mountains, indicating the bandits' camp is well-hidden and protected.

2. **Are there any signs of patrols?**
   - **Response**: A successful Perception check (DC 13) reveals signs of patrols, such as footprints and watch posts, suggesting the bandits are vigilant.

3. **Is there any indication of how many bandits there are?**
   - **Response**: A successful Survival check (DC 15) suggests the camp houses a significant number of bandits, possibly 15-20 individuals.

#### Encounter: Bandit Patrol

As you venture deeper, you come across a small patrol of bandits, seemingly scouting the area for intruders.

**Combat Encounter**:
- **Bandits** (use Bandit stats from the Monster Manual) - 4 bandits initially, with a chance of reinforcements if the fight goes on too long.

**Tactics**: The bandits will try to alert the main camp if they feel overwhelmed, using hit-and-run tactics to buy time.

### Scene 3: The Bandit Camp

#### Setting the Scene

After dealing with the patrol, you find the entrance to the bandit camp nestled in a rocky valley. The camp is surrounded by makeshift barricades and guarded by lookout towers. Fires burn in the center, and you can see bandits milling about, preparing for their next raid.

**What You Don't See**: The camp appears deceptively quiet, with most of the bandits likely inside their tents or on guard duty.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

   - **Response**: A successful Stealth check (DC 15) allows you to approach the camp unnoticed, finding a weak point in their defenses.

2. **Are there any leaders we should target?**
   - **Response**: A successful Investigation check (DC 14) reveals the bandit leader's tent, heavily guarded and positioned in the center of the camp.

3. **Can we create a distraction?**
   - **Response**: Yes, creating a distraction, such as setting a fire or causing a commotion, can draw some bandits away from their posts, making it easier to infiltrate the camp.

#### Final Encounter: Bandit Leader

Inside the camp, you confront the bandit leader, a tall, scarred man with a menacing presence. He commands a group of loyal bandits who will fight to protect him and the camp.

**Combat Encounter**:
- **Bandit Leader** (use Bandit Captain stats from the Monster Manual)
- **Bandits** (use Bandit stats from the Monster Manual) - 6 bandits as backup.

**Tactics**: The bandit leader fights fiercely, using his bandits to create a defensive perimeter. He will try to exploit any weaknesses in the adventurers' formation.

### Scene 4: Resolution

#### Setting the Scene

After defeating the bandit leader and his followers, you search the camp for any remaining threats and gather evidence of their raids. You find stolen goods, maps of their planned attacks, and personal belongings of the caravan victims.

**What You Don't See**: The camp is now in disarray, with the remaining bandits either fleeing or surrendering.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **What should we do with the captured bandits?**
   - **Response**: Captured bandits can be turned over to the local authorities in Eboncrest for justice and to send a message to other would-be criminals.

2. **What about the stolen goods?**
   - **Response**: Returning the stolen goods to the caravan survivors will help them recover from the attacks and bolster your reputation as honorable adventurers.

3. **Should we report this to the Adventurers' Guild?**
   - **Response**: Yes, reporting your success to the Adventurers' Guild will secure your reward and increase your standing within the guild.

#### Next Steps

**Secure the Camp**: Ensure no bandits remain and secure any valuable information.

**Return to the Guild**: Report your findings and success to the Adventurers' Guild to claim your reward.

**Investigate Further**: Optionally, the adventurers could choose to investigate the bandits' connections and whether there are other camps in the area.
