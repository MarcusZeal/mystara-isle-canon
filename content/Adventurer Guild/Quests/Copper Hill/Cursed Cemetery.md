**What You Don't See**: Hidden among the villagers, a ghostly figure watches from a distance, fading away before you can notice.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **What strange occurrences have been happening at the cemetery?**
   - **Response**: "People have seen ghostly apparitions, heard eerie whispers, and felt a chilling presence. Some say the dead have risen from their graves."

### Scene 2: Investigating the Cemetery

#### Setting the Scene

Following the villagers' accounts, you make your way to the outskirts of Copper Hill, where the cursed cemetery lies. The cemetery is shrouded in mist, with ancient tombstones and crypts barely visible through the fog. The air is heavy with a sense of dread.

**What You Don't See**: Hidden among the gravestones, restless spirits watch your every move, waiting for the right moment to strike.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

### Scene 3: The Source of the Curse

#### Setting the Scene

After dealing with the restless spirits, you find an old, decrepit crypt at the center of the cemetery. The crypt's entrance is adorned with dark symbols, and a faint glow emanates from within. The air grows colder as you approach, the sense of dread intensifying.

**What You Don't See**: Deep within the crypt, a necromancer conducts a dark ritual, unaware of your presence.

3. **Are there any traps or defenses?**
   - **Response**: A successful Perception check (DC 13) reveals magical wards and physical traps protecting the crypt's entrance.

#### Encounter: Necromancer and Undead

Inside the crypt, you confront the necromancer responsible for the curse, along with his undead minions.

**Combat Encounter**:
- **Necromancer** (use Necromancer stats from the Monster Manual)
- **Undead Minions** (use Skeleton or Zombie stats from the Monster Manual) - 6 minions as backup.

**Tactics**: The necromancer will use his magic to weaken and control you, while his undead minions provide a relentless assault.

### Scene 4: Resolution

#### Setting the Scene

After defeating the necromancer and his minions, you search the crypt for any remaining threats and clues. The dark ritual is disrupted, and the oppressive aura begins to lift. The cemetery slowly returns to a state of eerie calm.

**What You Don't See**: The last remnants of the necromancer's dark power dissipate, freeing the spirits trapped within the cemetery.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **What should we do with the necromancer's remains?**
   - **Response**: Destroying the necromancer's remains ensures he cannot return, and any valuable items can be turned over to the local authorities.

2. **Is the curse truly lifted?**
   - **Response**: A successful Arcana check (DC 13) confirms that the curse has been broken, though lingering effects may take time to fully dissipate.

3. **Should we report this to the Adventurers' Guild?**
   - **Response**: Yes, reporting your success to the Adventurers' Guild will secure your reward and increase your standing within the guild.

#### Next Steps

**Secure the Crypt**: Ensure no dark magic remains and secure any valuable information.

**Return to the Guild**: Report your findings and success to the Adventurers' Guild to claim your reward.

**Investigate Further**: Optionally, the adventurers could choose to investigate the necromancer's connections and whether there are other sources of dark magic in the area.
