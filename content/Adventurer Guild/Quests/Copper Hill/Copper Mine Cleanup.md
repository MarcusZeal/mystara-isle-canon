### Scene 1: Investigating the Mine Entrance

#### Setting the Scene

As you approach the old copper mine, you see the once-busy entrance now overgrown with weeds and vines. The wooden support beams creak under the weight of neglect, and a faint, musty smell wafts from within. The area is eerily quiet, save for the occasional rustle of leaves.

**What You Don't See**: Despite the silence outside, the mine teems with life inside, hidden from view.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **What happened to the mine?**
   - **Response**: "The mine was abandoned after a series of beast attacks. Workers reported seeing strange creatures and hearing unsettling noises."

2. **What kind of creatures are inside?**
   - **Response**: "We're not sure. The miners only mentioned glimpses of large, shadowy figures and glowing eyes."

3. **Is there another entrance?**
   - **Response**: "There is a ventilation shaft on the other side of the hill, but it's a tight squeeze and risky to enter."

#### Investigation and Clues

**Perception Check (DC 12)**:
- Success: You notice fresh tracks and signs of recent activity near the entrance, indicating that the beasts are still inside.
- Failure: The overgrowth and debris make it difficult to discern any clear signs of recent activity.

**Nature Check (DC 14)**:
- Success: You identify the tracks as belonging to a variety of wild beasts, including wolves and giant spiders.
- Failure: The tracks are too muddled to identify clearly.

### Scene 2: Exploring the Mine Interior

#### Setting the Scene

As you enter the mine, the temperature drops, and the light dims to near darkness. Your footsteps echo against the stone walls, and the air grows thick with the scent of damp earth and decay. Rusted mining equipment lies scattered around, abandoned in haste.

**What You Don't See**: Hidden in the shadows, the wild beasts lie in wait, ready to defend their new territory.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **How deep does the mine go?**
   - **Response**: "The mine extends deep into the hill, with several branching tunnels and shafts. It's easy to get lost if you're not careful."

2. **Are there any dangerous areas?**
   - **Response**: "Some of the tunnels have collapsed over time, creating unstable ground and hidden pitfalls."

3. **Can we find anything valuable?**
   - **Response**: "There might be some leftover copper veins or old mining equipment, but the main priority is clearing out the beasts."

#### Encounter: Wild Beasts

As you venture deeper into the mine, you come across the first group of wild beasts.

**Combat Encounter**:
- **Wolves** (use Wolf stats from the Monster Manual) - 3 wolves initially, with 2 more joining after the first round.
- **Giant Spiders** (use Giant Spider stats from the Monster Manual) - 2 spiders hiding in the shadows, ready to ambush.

**Tactics**: The wolves will attempt to surround and outflank the adventurers, while the spiders use their webs to hinder movement and strike from above.

### Scene 3: Deeper into the Mine

#### Setting the Scene

After dealing with the initial group of beasts, you move deeper into the mine. The tunnels narrow, and the air becomes thicker with moisture. Bioluminescent fungi cling to the walls, casting an eerie glow on the rocky surfaces. The sound of dripping water echoes through the cavern.

**What You Don't See**: Deeper within the mine, larger and more dangerous beasts have made their lairs, sensing the intruders' approach.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **Is there a central chamber?**
   - **Response**: "Yes, there's a larger chamber further in that was once used as a storage area for the mined copper. It might be where the beasts are congregating."

2. **Are there any signs of the miners?**
   - **Response**: "You find old tools and personal belongings scattered around, but no signs of the miners themselves. They likely fled in a hurry."

3. **Is the structure safe?**
   - **Response**: "The deeper you go, the more unstable the mine becomes. Proceed with caution to avoid cave-ins."

### Scene 4: The Central Chamber

#### Setting the Scene

You enter the central chamber of the mine, a vast, open space with high ceilings supported by thick wooden beams. The remnants of mining operations are evident, with rusted carts and tracks leading to deeper tunnels. The bioluminescent fungi are thicker here, casting an eerie, greenish light. 

**What You Don't See**: The largest and most dangerous beasts lurk in the shadows, ready to defend their territory.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **Are there any more beasts here?**
   - **Response**: A successful Perception check (DC 14) reveals the sounds of low growls and the glint of eyes watching from the darkness.

2. **Can we use the old equipment?**
   - **Response**: A successful Investigation check (DC 13) finds some usable mining equipment that can be repurposed as improvised weapons or tools.

3. **Is there a way to collapse the mine if needed?**
   - **Response**: A successful Survival check (DC 15) identifies weak points in the structure that could be targeted to collapse tunnels and trap or deter the beasts.

#### Final Encounter: The Alpha Beasts

In the central chamber, you face the alpha beasts leading the wild creatures within the mine.

**Combat Encounter**:
- **Alpha Wolf** (use Dire Wolf stats from the Monster Manual)
- **Giant Spider** (use Giant Spider stats from the Monster Manual) - 2 spiders supporting the alpha wolf.

**Tactics**: The alpha wolf commands the other beasts, coordinating their attacks. The giant spiders use their webs to create barriers and ambush points.

### Scene 5: Resolution

#### Setting the Scene

After defeating the alpha beasts, the mine falls silent, and the threat is neutralized. You can now safely explore the central chamber and the surrounding tunnels to ensure no beasts remain.

**What You Don't See**: The remaining beasts, sensing the loss of their leaders, retreat further into the wilderness, leaving the mine abandoned.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **What should we do with the remaining beasts?**
   - **Response**: Any captured or remaining beasts can be driven out of the mine and into the wilderness, ensuring they don't return.

2. **Is it safe for the miners to return?**
   - **Response**: A thorough inspection of the mine reveals it to be safe, but repairs to the structure will be needed before full operations can resume.

3. **Should we report this to the Adventurers' Guild?**
   - **Response**: Yes, reporting your success to the Adventurers' Guild will secure your reward and ensure the mine's reopening is officially sanctioned.

#### Next Steps

**Secure the Mine**: Ensure all remaining beasts are driven out and the mine is safe for the miners to return.

**Return to the Guild**: Report your findings and success to the Adventurers' Guild to claim your reward.

**Investigate Further**: Optionally, the adventurers could choose to investigate any deeper tunnels or hidden passages within the mine.

#### Quest Completion

Upon successful completion, the adventurers receive 250 Gold and 1 Common Rarity Magic Ring or Armor. They also gain recognition for their efforts in ensuring the safety of Copper Hill's mining operations, leading to more opportunities and quests in the future.
