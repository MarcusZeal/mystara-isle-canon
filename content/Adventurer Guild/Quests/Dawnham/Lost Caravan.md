After dealing with the ambush, you follow the tracks to a hidden camp deeper in the forest. The camp is well-concealed, surrounded by thick trees and underbrush. You can see the caravan's wagons and goods, along with tied-up merchants and guards.

3. **Can we create a distraction?**
   - **Response**: Yes, creating a distraction, such as setting a fire or causing a commotion, can draw some bandits away from their posts, making it easier to infiltrate the camp.

#### Final Encounter: Bandit Leader

Inside the camp, you confront the bandit leader, a cunning and ruthless figure who commands the loyalty of the bandits.

**Combat Encounter**:
- **Bandit Leader** (use Bandit Captain stats from the Monster Manual)

#### Potential Questions and Answers
