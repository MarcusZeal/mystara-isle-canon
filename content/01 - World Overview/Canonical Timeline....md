### Timeline Recap

**5750 B.C. (Before Cataclysm)**: - The Eldorans, a race of elves who worshipped the elements struck down their moon god, [[Lupara]]. **Lupara is dead**, which is why she has been silent for millennia. The Eldorans harvested Lupara's heart, a dense, magic infused crystal that regenerates even after Lupara's passing. 
**5500 B.C.:** The Eldorans' master use of these blue crystals, called **Lunashards**, harvested from Lupara's heart. This lead to the Eldoran civilization expanding across the world. Their constructs and magic paved the way for thousands of years of prosperity.

- **0 B.C.**: Vyrra confronts the Thorne family, who are attempting to kill another god to harvest its power. During their battle, Lupara's Heart is struck, causing a massive explosion.

Vyrra is transformed into an ageless hag, and the surviving Eldorans scatter, becoming a lost legend.
