## First Time
### Setting the Scene

> Nestled within the bustling heart of [[Eboncrest]], [[The Adventurers' Guild]] stands as a beacon of opportunity and camaraderie. The grand stone building is adorned with banners displaying the guild's emblem â€“ a sword crossed with a staff, encircled by a wreath of laurel leaves. The entrance is flanked by two imposing statues of renowned adventurers from ages past, their expressions resolute and inspiring.
> 
> As you step inside, the interior is a blend of rustic charm and organized efficiency. Wooden beams support the high ceiling, and large windows allow streams of sunlight to illuminate the spacious hall. The air is filled with the hum of activity as adventurers of all races and backgrounds gather to share tales, form parties, and seek their next challenge.
> 
> At the front desk stands a confident young woman. Your memory of Earth leads you to believe that she is clearly the attendant or stewardess of some sort for this guild.

Her dark hair is neatly tied back, and she wears the guild's uniform with pride, a badge of rank pinned to her chest.

**Key Features**:

- **Appearance**: Marisella has a composed demeanor, her posture exuding confidence and authority. She is meticulous in her duties, ensuring that every adventurer is properly registered and well-informed.
- **Desk**: The desk is organized, with stacks of parchment, quills, and inkpots neatly arranged. A large ledger lies open, ready to record the details of new recruits and quest registrations.
- **Rank**: It's clear that Marisella is not a high rank in the guild. All attendance appear to be well respected by those in the lobby, but you get the definite vibe that she's not the highest ranking official of the Adventurer's Guild here.

#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **How do we register as adventurers?**

   - **Marisella Voss**: "To register as adventurers, you need to fill out these forms with your names, skills, and any previous experience. Normally, there's a 100 gold entrance fee, but I see you have a letter of recommendation from Captain Darius. With this, you can bypass the fee."

2. **What benefits do we get as registered adventurers?**

   - **Marisella Voss**: "As registered members, you'll have access to our quest board, training facilities, and exclusive guild resources. You'll also earn guild points for completing quests, which can be used for various perks and privileges within the guild."

3. **Can we take on any quest from the board?**

   - **Marisella Voss**: "You may take on quests that match your skill level. Start with Bronze or Silver quests to build your reputation and skills. As you prove yourselves, you'll gain access to more challenging quests."

4. **What if we need help or advice on a quest?**

   - **Marisella Voss**: "Feel free to consult with me or any of the senior guild members. We can provide guidance, support, and sometimes even additional resources to help you succeed."

   - **Answer**: Simply choose a quest from the board that suits your skills and experience. Once you've made your selection, speak with the guild clerk at the nearby desk to officially register your party for the quest.

6. **Can we take multiple quests at once?**

   - **Answer**: Yes, you can take on multiple quests, provided you feel confident in your ability to complete them. Just ensure each quest is registered properly with the guild clerk.

7. **Are there any rewards for completing quests?**

   - **Answer**: Absolutely. Each quest comes with its own set of rewards, which may include gold, items, and guild points. Completing quests also enhances your reputation within the guild, potentially granting you access to higher-tier quests and exclusive opportunities.

8. **What happens if we fail a quest?**

   - **Answer**: Failure is a part of adventuring. If you fail a quest, report back to the guild with the details. Depending on the circumstances, the guild may offer support or advice for a future attempt. Repeated failures, however, might affect your standing within the guild.

#### Interaction with Marisella

Upon presenting Darius's letter of recommendation, Marisella's eyes light up with recognition.

**Marisella Voss**: "Ah, a letter from Captain Darius himself! He speaks highly of you. With his endorsement, you are more than welcome to join our ranks without the entrance fee. Let me just record your details in the ledger... and I'll get this note over to Thorne so he can review it later. No need to pester him with something this trivial right now."

#### Registration Process

Marisella hands you the registration forms and assists you in filling them out if needed. She meticulously records each member's information in the guild ledger, ensuring that everything is in order.

**Registration Forms**:
- **Names**
- **Skills and Abilities**
- **Previous Experience** 
- **Next of Kin**

#### Finalizing Registration

Once the forms are completed and recorded, Marisella hands you your official guild badges.

**Marisella Voss**: "Welcome to the Adventurers Guild, Eboncrest office. Wear these badges proudly, and may your adventures be successful and rewarding. If you have any questions or need assistance, do not hesitate to ask."

**The badges** aren't wearable persay. They are insignias with the guild's crest stamped on it. On the opposite side, you can see the information you provided in your registration etched neatly into the sturdy iron.
