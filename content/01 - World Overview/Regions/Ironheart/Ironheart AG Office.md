#### Potential Questions and Answers

1. **How do we register as adventurers?**

   - **Marisella Voss**: "To register as adventurers, you need to fill out these forms with your names, skills, and any previous experience. Normally, there's a 100 gold entrance fee, but I see you have a letter of recommendation from Captain Darius. With this, you can bypass the fee."

2. **What benefits do we get as registered adventurers?**

   - **Marisella Voss**: "As registered members, you'll have access to our quest board, training facilities, and exclusive guild resources. You'll also earn guild points for completing quests, which can be used for various perks and privileges within the guild."

3. **Can we take on any quest from the board?**

   - **Marisella Voss**: "You may take on quests that match your skill level. Start with Bronze or Silver quests to build your reputation and skills. As you prove yourselves, you'll gain access to more challenging quests."

4. **What if we need help or advice on a quest?**

   - **Marisella Voss**: "Feel free to consult with me or any of the senior guild members. We can provide guidance, support, and sometimes even additional resources to help you succeed."

5. **How do we take on a quest?**

   - **Answer**: Simply choose a quest from the board that suits your skills and experience. Once you've made your selection, speak with the guild clerk at the nearby desk to officially register your party for the quest.

6. **Can we take multiple quests at once?**

   - **Answer**: Yes, you can take on multiple quests, provided you feel confident in your ability to complete them. Just ensure each quest is registered properly with the guild clerk.

7. **Are there any rewards for completing quests?**

   - **Answer**: Absolutely. Each quest comes with its own set of rewards, which may include gold, items, and guild points. Completing quests also enhances your reputation within the guild, potentially granting you access to higher-tier quests and exclusive opportunities.

8. **What happens if we fail a quest?**

   - **Answer**: Failure is a part of adventuring. If you fail a quest, report back to the guild with the details. Depending on the circumstances, the guild may offer support or advice for a future attempt. Repeated failures, however, might affect your standing within the guild.
