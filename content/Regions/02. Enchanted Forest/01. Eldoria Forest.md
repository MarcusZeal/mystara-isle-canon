- **[[02. Enchanted Glade]]**: A serene clearing bathed in a perpetual, otherworldly light.

The forest's tranquility has been disturbed, and signs of unrest are evident as goblins and other threats emerge.

- **[[03. Whispering Glade]]:** A tranquil, secluded glade where the wind seems to carry voices
  from the past. The whispers are said to be the voices of ancient spirits, offering guidance or warnings to those who listen. It’s a place of reflection and mystery, where the forest’s magic is palpable.

- **[[04. Bear Wood]]**: A dense area of the forest known for its population of large, imposing bears.

Bear Wood is a place of raw, untamed nature, where danger lurks behind every tree.

- **[[05. Copper Rise]]**: A hilly region named for the veins of copper that run through the earth.

- **[[06. Dawnham Passage]]**: A narrow, winding path that leads travelers through the heart of the forest towards Dawnham. The passage is flanked by ancient trees whose branches form a natural archway overhead. It’s a route filled with both beauty and peril, as the forest’s enchantments can easily lead the unwary astray.

- **[[07. Eboncrest Hollow]]**: A secluded hollow named for the dark, twisted trees that grow here. The hollow is shrouded in perpetual twilight, creating an eerie atmosphere.
