### The Arousing Whale Pub


> The Arousing Whale Pub is a quiet welcoming Tavern. Through the stone brick walls you can hear carousing. Several wooden signs advertising cheap drinks.  
> 
> **As you open the rough tavern door** you are welcomed by a scattering of patrons. It seems just as welcoming inside as it does from the outside. Dim candle light illuminates the room and standing behind the polished stone bar is an athletic 5'1" half-elf male with an edgy face, short, wavy, red hair, blue eyes, and soft, sunburned, tan skin. He is wearing a loose tan tunic, and baggy brown pants.  
> 
> **Between you and the bartender** is a small collection of wooden booths, to the left is a hearth with a roaring flame within, and to the left is a wooden staircase.
