The Hidden Cave within the Enchanted Glade serves as a crucial point in the adventurers' journey, drawing them deeper into the mysteries of Eldoria Forest. This cave, well-concealed by thick foliage and a natural rock formation, is a testament to the forest’s ability to hide secrets from those who do not look closely.

#### Description

The entrance to the Hidden Cave is a narrow, shadowy opening partially obscured by hanging vines and moss-covered stones. As travelers enter, they are greeted by the damp, cool air of the underground passage. The cave's interior is dimly lit by patches of luminescent fungi that cast an eerie glow on the walls, revealing a rough-hewn path leading deeper into the darkness.

#### Encounters

Upon entering the cave, adventurers soon find signs of recent activity—discarded bones, remnants of campfires, and crude markings on the walls that hint at the presence of goblins. Initial exploration reveals a small group of goblin scouts guarding the entrance.

#### Key Discoveries


- **Map to the Goblin Lair**: A crude map found among the goblin leader's belongings leads to the goblin lair deeper in Eldoria Forest, suggesting a well-organized threat that needs to be addressed.
